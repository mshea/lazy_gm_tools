  <h3>Monster Features</h3>
  <p>Give any custom monster impactful features and attacks that make sense for their place in the game. When a monster feature deals damage, choose a damage type appropriate to the creature's physiology, theme, or story. A creature channeling magical power might deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, force, poison, psychic, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage. A creature making use of spines, spikes, or projectiles might deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damaging Blast.</em></strong> This creature has one or more single-target ranged attacks using the attack bonus and damage calculated above, and which deal damage of an appropriate type.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damage Reflection.</em></strong> Whenever a creature within 5 feet of this creature hits them with a melee attack, the attacker takes damage in return of a type appropriate to the creature. The damage dealt is equal to half the damage of one of this creature's attacks. If you give a creature this feature, give them one less attack than normal.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Misty Step.</em></strong> As a bonus action, this creature can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space they can see.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Knockdown.</em></strong> When this creature hits a target with a melee attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Restraining Grab.</em></strong> When this creature hits a target with a melee attack, the target is grappled (escape DC based on this creature's Strength or Dexterity modifier). While grappled, the target is restrained.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damaging Burst.</em></strong> As an action, this creature can create a burst of energy, magic, spines, or some other effect in a 10-foot-radius sphere, either around themself or at a point within 120 feet. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw (your choice, based on the type of burst). On a failure, a target takes damage of an appropriate type equal to half this creature's total damage per round. On a success, a target takes half as much damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Cunning Action</em></strong>. On each of their turns, this creature can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damaging Aura.</em></strong> Each creature who starts their turn within 10 feet of this creature takes damage of a type appropriate to the creature. The damage dealt is equal to half the damage of one of this creature's attacks. If you give a creature this feature, give them one less attack than normal.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Energy Weapons.</em></strong> The creature's weapon attacks deal extra damage of an appropriate type. You can add this damage on top of the creature's regular damage output to give them a combat boost, or you can replace some of the creature's normal weapon damage with this energy damage.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Damage Transference.</em></strong> When this creature takes damage, they can transfer half or all of that damage (your choice) to a willing creature within 30 or 60 feet of them. This feature is particularly good for boss monsters.</p>
  
  <h2>Conditions</h2>
  <p>Creatures may inflict conditions on attacks. Here's a list of potential conditions. Be careful to ensure such conditions don't take away too much agency from the characters or their players. Aim towards fun.</p>
  
   <h3>Blinded</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A blinded creature can't see and it automatically fails ability checks that require sight.</li>
 <li>Attack rolls against a blinded creature are made with advantage, and the creature's attack rolls are made with disadvantage.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Charmed</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A charmed creature can't take any hostile action against the charmer.</li>
 <li>Ability checks the charmer makes to socially interact with the charmed creature have advantage.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Confused</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A confused creature can't take reactions.</li>
 <li>On its turn a confused creature rolls a d8 to determine what it does. 
 <ul>
 <li>On a 1 to 4, a confused creature does nothing. </li>
 <li>On a 5 or 6, a confused creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. </li>
 <li>On a 7 or 8, a confused creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.</li>
 </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>

<h3>Doomed</h3>
<ul>
<li>A doomed creature dies at a time determined by the GM, or within 13 (2d12) hours.</li>
<li>A doomed creature continues to be doomed even after it dies. Magic equivalent to a 7th-level or higher spell can remove the doomed condition (such as regenerate cast on a living creature, resurrection, true resurrection, or wish).</li>
</ul>

 <h3>Frightened</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while it is able to see the source of its fear.</li>
 <li>A frightened creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li>

 <h3>Grappled</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A grappled creature's Speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to movement speeds.</li>
 <li>If the grappler becomes incapacitated the condition ends.</li>
 <li>If an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect the condition ends.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Incapacitated</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>An incapacitated creature can't take actions, bonus actions, or reactions.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Paralyzed</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A paralyzed creature is incapacitated and can't move or speak.</li>
 <li>A paralyzed creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. </li>
 <li>Attack rolls against a paralyzed creature have advantage.</li>
 <li>Any attack that hits a paralyzed creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Petrified</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A petrified creature (and all of its mundane possessions) is transformed into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). </li>
 <li>A petrified creature's weight is increased by a factor of ten and it ceases aging.</li>
 <li>A petrified creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
 <li>A petrified creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
 <li>A petrified creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
 <li>A petrified creature is immune to poison and disease (time spent petrified does not affect the duration of a poison or disease already in its system).</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Poisoned</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Prone</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl (every 1 foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot) until it stands up.</li>
 <li>Standing up requires half a creature's movement.</li>
 <li>A prone creature makes melee attack rolls with disadvantage.</li>
 <li>An attack roll against a prone creature is made with advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet. Otherwise, the attack roll is made with disadvantage.</li>

 </ul>
 <h3>Restrained</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A restrained creature's Speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.</li>
 <li>Attack rolls against a restrained creature are made with advantage.</li>
 <li>A restrained creature makes attack rolls with disadvantage.</li>
 <li>The restrained creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Slowed</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A slowed creature's Speed is halved.</li>
 <li>A slowed creature takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
 <li>A slowed creature cannot take reactions.</li>
 <li>On its turn, a slowed creature can take either an action or a bonus action, not both. In addition, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Stunned</h3>
 <ul>
 <li>A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move, and can speak only falteringly.</li>
 <li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
 <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Unconscious</h3>

 <li>An unconscious creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
 <li>An unconscious creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</li>
 <li>An unconscious creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
 <li>Attack rolls against an unconscious creature are made with advantage.</li>
 <li>Any attack that hits an unconscious creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Tracked Conditions</h3>
 <p>Various challenges, obstacles, and magics can lead to either fatigue or strife. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of fatigue or strife (detailed in the effect's description).</p>
 <p>If a creature suffering from fatigue or strife fails to resist another effect that causes a level of the tracked condition, its current level increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>
 <p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level in a tracked condition as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 3 fatigue has its Speed halved, it cannot Sprint, and it makes Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks with disadvantage.</p>
 <p>An effect that removes a tracked condition reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all tracked condition effects ending when a creature's condition level is reduced below 1.</p>
 <p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's fatigue and strife levels by 1.</p>
 
 <h3>Fatigue</h3>
 <p>Fatigue represents exhaustion, exposure, hunger, injuries, and other physical factors which gradually wear a creature down. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the fatigue track becomes doomed and dies.</p>
 <p><strong>Fatigue Level Effects</strong></p>
 <ol>
 <li>Cannot dash.</li>
 <li>Disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks.</li>
 <li>Speed halved.</li>
 <li>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws using Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</li>
 <li>Hit Dice halved.</li>
 <li>Speed reduced to 5 ft.</li>
 <li>Doomed.</li>
 </ol>
 <h3>Strife</h3>
 <p>Strife represents corruption, despair, fear, loss of resolve, and other mental factors which gradually undo a creature's very soul. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the strife track suffers a special, permanent effect, which is either randomly selected or decided by the GM. This might involve the creature shutting down completely, or being impacted in such a way that it is forever changed.</p>
 <p><strong>Strife Level Effects</strong></p>
 <ol>
<li>Disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks.</li>
 <li>Disadvantage on concentration checks.</li>
 <li>Can only take a bonus action or action each turn (not both).</li>
 <li>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws using Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.</li>
 <li>Suffer the effects of a randomly determined short-term mental stress effect.</li>
 <li>Cannot cast spells (but can cast cantrips).</li>
 <li>Suffer the effects of a randomly determined long-term mental stress effect.</li>
 </ol>
