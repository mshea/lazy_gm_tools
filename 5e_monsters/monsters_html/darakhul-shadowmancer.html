<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master of Disguise:</strong> A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses its stench.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Stealth:</strong> While in dim light or darkness, the darakhul shadowmancer can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</li>
<li><strong>Stench:</strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul's Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul shadowmancer using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Defiance:</strong> The darakhul shadowmancer and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The darakhul shadowmancer is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will): acid splash, chill touch, mage hand, prestidigitation
1st level (4 slots): mage armor, ray of sickness, silent image
2nd level (3 slots): misty step, scorching ray, see invisibility
3rd level (3 slots): animate dead, dispel magic, stinking cloud
4th level (2 slots): arcane eye, black tentacles, confusion
5th level (1 slot): teleportation circle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The darakhul shadowmancer makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its dagger.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage, and, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.</li>
