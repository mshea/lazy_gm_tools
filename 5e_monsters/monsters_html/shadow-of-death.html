<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Throes:</strong> When the shadow of death dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Deathly Shroud:</strong> At the start of each of the shadow of death’s turns, each creature within 15 feet of it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, light within 30 feet of the shadow of death is less effective. Bright light in the area becomes dim light, and dim light in the area becomes darkness.
- <strong>Destroyer of Life:</strong> If the shadow of death reduces a creature to 0 hp, the creature can be restored to life only by means of a wish spell.
- <strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The shadow of death has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- <strong>Shadow Stealth:</strong> While in dim light or darkness, the shadow of death can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
- <strong>Weapons of Death:</strong> The shadow of death’s weapon attacks are magical. When the shadow of death hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage (included in the attack).</p>
<p>A creature that takes necrotic damage from the shadow death’s weapon must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The shadow of death can use Vision of Ending. It then makes three shortsword attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Shortsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Vision of Ending:</strong> Each creature that is not undead within 60 feet of the shadow of death that can see it must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened in this way, the creature is also paralyzed as it sees visions of its death. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this shadow of death’s Vision of Ending for the next 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Teleport:</strong> The shadow of death magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</li>
