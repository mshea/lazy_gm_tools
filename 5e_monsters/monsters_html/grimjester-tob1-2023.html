<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Last Laugh:</strong> Unless it is destroyed in a manner amusing to the god of death that created it, the grim jester gains a new body in 1d20 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears in a place of the god’s choosing.</li>

<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Necrotic Claw:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, range 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Killing Joke:</strong> The grim jester tells an ancient, nihilistic joke to one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone in a fit of laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for 1 minute. A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is reduced to 0 hp instead. The incapacitated target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save or ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The grim jester casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):<br/>At will: disguise self, grease<br/>3/day each: magic mouth (as an action), mirror image<br/>1/day each: mislead, seeming</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joker’s Shuffle (Recharge 6):</strong> The grim jester exchanges locations with a Medium or smaller creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The jester and target each teleport to the other’s space, and each becomes covered in a magical illusion to look and sound like the other. A creature must take an action to visually inspect an illusion and succeed on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the jester and target are disguised. The illusions last for 1 minute, until the jester dies, or until the jester dismisses them as a bonus action.</li>
