<h3>Special Abilities</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anger of the Ancient Mage:</strong> The pillar of lost magocracy unleashes a random magical attack on a target or area within 120 feet. Roll a d4 to determine the effect:<br/>1. Mutant Plants. Grasping tendrils of alien vegetation sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the pillar can see within 120 feet. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained. Treat as an entangle spell, except it only lasts for 2d4 rounds.<br/>2. Acid Rain. Corrosive acid falls from the sky centered on a point the pillar can see within 120 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br/>3. Noxious Cloud. The pillar creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of reddish, stinging mist centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The area is heavily obscured, and each creature inside the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is blinded until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. The cloud lasts for 1d4 rounds.<br/>4. Shrinking Ray. A bright green ray strikes a single creature within 120 feet. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be shrunk to half its size. Treat as an enlarge/reduce spell, except it lasts for 2d4 rounds.</li>
