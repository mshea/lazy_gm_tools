<li><strong>Know Thoughts:</strong> The aatxe can use an action to read the surface thoughts of one creature within 30 feet. This works like the detect thoughts spell, except it can only read surface thoughts and there is no limit to the duration. It can end this effect as a bonus action or by using an action to change the target. Limited Speech (Humanoid Form Only). The aatxe can verbally communicate only simple ideas and phrases, though it can understand and follow a conversation without issue.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The aatxe has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Shapechanger:</strong> The aatxe can use its action to polymorph into a Medium male humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
