<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggressive Charge:</strong> The eye moves up to their Speed towards an enemy they can see or hear.</li>
<li><strong>Warhordling Orc Eye Spellcasting:</strong> The eye has advantage on attack rolls made against targets they can see with arcane eye.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The priest is a 5th level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13
 +5 to hit with spell attacks). They have the following cleric spells prepared:
 Cantrips (at will): guidance
 sacred flame
 thaumaturgy
 1st-level (4 slots): ceremony
 detect evil and good
 guiding bolt
bless
 2nd-level (3 slots): lesser restoration

 3rd-level (2 slots): dispel magic

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mace:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. On a hit  the priest can expend a spell slot to deal 7 (2d6) radiant damage  plus an extra 3 (1d6) radiant damage for each level of the spell slot expended above 1st.</li>
<li><strong>Sacred Flame (Cantrip; V, S):</strong> One creature the priest can see within 60 feet makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage on a failure. This spell ignores cover.</li>
<li><strong>Guiding Bolt (1st-Level; V, S):</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit  range 120 ft.  one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) radiant damage  and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of the priests next turn has advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Dispel Magic (3rd-Level; V, S):</strong> The priest scours the magic from one creature  object  or magical effect within 120 feet that they can see. A spell ends if it was cast with a 3rd-level or lower spell slot. For spells using a 4th-level or higher spell slot  the priest makes a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + the spells level) for each one  ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spirit Guardians (3rd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):</strong> Spectral forms surround the priest in a 10-foot radius for 10 minutes. The priest can choose creatures they can see to be unaffected by the spell. Other creatures treat the area as difficult terrain  and when a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there  it makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw  taking 10 (3d6) radiant or necrotic damage (priests choice) on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healing Word (1st-Level; V):</strong> The priest or a living creature within 60 feet regains 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points. The priest can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.</li>
<li><strong>The priests of orcish war hordes act as counselors and magical scouts:</strong> Some even put out their own eyes, trusting in their magical senses and intuition to lead the horde.</li>
