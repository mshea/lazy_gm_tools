<li>Paladin of Shoth. The oth derives its power from Shoth itself, its zom shining with sacred light. Its Armor Class increases by 2. A non-shoth creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the oth must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded by the light of Shoth until the end of its turn.</li>
