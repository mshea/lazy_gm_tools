<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evasion:</strong> If the darakhul spy is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</li>
<li><strong>Master of Disguise:</strong> A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its Stench.</li>
<li><strong>Sneak Attack (1/Turn):</strong> The darakhul spy deals an extra 7 (2d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the darakhul spy that isn’t incapacitated and the darakhul doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Stench:</strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Defiance:</strong> The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The darakhul makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, and one with its shortsword.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and, if the target creature is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid creature is paralyzed for more than 2 rounds, it contracts darakhul fever.</li>
<li><strong>Shortsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Light Crossbow:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.</li>
