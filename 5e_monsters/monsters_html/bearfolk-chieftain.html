<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brute:</strong> A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bearfolk cheiftain hits with it (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Frenzy (1/rest):</strong> As a bonus action, the bearfolk can trigger a berserk frenzy that lasts 1 minute. While in frenzy, it gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks and has advantage on attack rolls. Attack rolls made against a frenzied bearfolk have advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Keen Smell:</strong> The bearfolk has advantage on Wisdom(Perception) checks that rely on smell.</li>
<li><strong>Savage Charge:</strong> If the bearfolk moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a battleaxe attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the bearfolk can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The bearfolk makes two attacks with its battleaxe and one with its bite.</li>
<li><strong>Battleaxe:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage if used two-handed.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):</strong> For 1 minute, the bearfolk chieftain can, as a reaction, utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the bearfolk chieftain. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the bearfolk chieftain is incapacitated.</li>
