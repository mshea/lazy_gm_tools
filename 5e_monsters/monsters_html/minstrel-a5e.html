<li><strong>Vicious Mockery (Cantrip; V):</strong> A creature within 60 feet that can hear the minstrel makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):</strong> The minstrel or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the invisible creature attacks or casts a spell.</li>
<li><strong>Shatter (2nd-Level; V, S, M):</strong> An ear-splitting ringing sound fills a 10-foot-radius sphere emanating from a point the minstrel can see within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw  taking 13 (3d8) thunder damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature made of stone  metal  or other inorganic material has disadvantage on its saving throw. Unattended objects in the area also take the damage.</li>
<li><strong>Hypnotic Pattern (3rd-Level; S, M, Concentration):</strong> A swirling pattern of light appears at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of the pattern that can see it makes a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the creature is charmed for 1 minute. While charmed  the creature is incapacitated and its Speed is 0. The effect ends on a creature if it takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it out of its daze.</li>
