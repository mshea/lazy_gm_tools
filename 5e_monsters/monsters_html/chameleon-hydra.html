<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple Heads:</strong> The chameleon hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious. Whenever the chameleon hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the chameleon hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Superior Camouflage:</strong> While the chameleon hydra remains motionless, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, the chameleon hydra can hide even while a creature can see it.</li>
<li><strong>Wakeful:</strong> While the chameleon hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The chameleon hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads. It can use its Sticky Tongue or Reel in place of a bite attack.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Sticky Tongue:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 50 ft., one target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the hydra can’t use the same sticky tongue on another target.</li>
<li><strong>Reel:</strong> The hydra pulls a creature grappled by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.</li>
