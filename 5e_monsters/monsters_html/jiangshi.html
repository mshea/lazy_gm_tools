<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blind Senses:</strong> The jiangshi can't use its blindsight while deafened.</li>
<li><strong>Keen Hearing:</strong> The jiangshi has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</li>
<li><strong>Prayer of Magic Resistance:</strong> The jiangshi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. A creature can take its action while within 5 feet of the jiangshi to rip the prayer off the jiangshi by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. The jiangshi loses this trait if its prayer scroll is removed.</li>
<li><strong>Standing Leap:</strong> The jiangshi's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.</li>
<li><strong>Terrifying Appearance:</strong> When a creature that can see the jiangshi starts its turn within 30 feet of the jiangshi, it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless the jiangshi is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the jiangshi's Terrifying Appearance for the next 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The jiangshi makes two claw attacks. It can use Life Drain in place of one claw attack.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the jiangshi doesn't have two other creatures grappled.</li>
<li><strong>Life Drain:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is grappled by the jiangshi, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. <br/><br/>A humanoid slain in this way rises 24 hours later as a jiangshi, unless the humanoid is restored to life, its body is bathed in vinegar before burial, or its body is destroyed.</li>
