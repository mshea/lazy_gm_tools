A cursed creature can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the creatures total number of Hit Dice for every 24 hours that elapse. If this curse reduces the targets hit point maximum to 0, the target dies and crumbles to dust. Remove curse and similar magic ends the curse.</li>
<li><strong>Flammable:</strong> After taking fire damage, the mummy lord catches fire and takes 11 (2d10) ongoing fire damage if it isnt already suffering ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action or legendary action to extinguish this fire.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (1/Day):</strong> If the mummy lord fails a saving throw while wearing its scarab amulet, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, the scarab amulet shatters. The mummy lord can create a new amulet when it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The mummy lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Rejuvenation:</strong> If its heart is intact, a destroyed mummy lord gains a new body in 1d4 days, regaining all its hit points. The new body forms within 10 feet of the heart.</li>

On a failure  it is magically frightened until the end of the mummy lords next turn. If the target fails the save by 5 or more  it is paralyzed for the same duration.

<li><strong>Dispel Magic (3rd-Level; V, S):</strong> The mummy lord scours the magic from one creature  object  or magical effect it can see within 120 feet.

The spell ends when the guardian has dealt 60 total damage.</li>
<li><strong>Contagion (5th-Level; V, S):</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one creature. Hit: The target contracts a flesh-rotting disease. It has disadvantage on Charisma ability checks and becomes vulnerable to all damage. The target makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. After 3 failures  the target stops making saving throws and the disease lasts for 7 days. After 3 successes  the effect ends.</li>

The spells damage can't reduce a target to less than 1 hit point.</li>
