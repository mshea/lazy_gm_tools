</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, its scales dull briefly, and it can't use telepathy or psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Powers:</strong> The dragons psionic abilities are considered both magical and psionic.</li>
<li><strong>Far Thoughts:</strong> The dragon is aware of any creature that uses a psionic ability or communicates telepathically within 100 miles of it. As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water. The dragon can psionically observe a subject indefinitely and can end this effect and return to its own senses as an action.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 22). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:calm emotions, charm person, mass suggestion, modify memory,  1/day:plane shift, project image</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws. In place of its bite  it can use Psionic Wave.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claws:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Wave:</strong> The dragon psionically emits a wave of crushing mental pressure. Each creature within 20 feet makes a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw  taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Creatures charmed by the dragon make this saving throw with disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Concussive Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon psionically unleashes telekinetic energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 21 Constitution saving throw  taking 82 (15d10) force damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assume Control (While Bloodied):</strong> When a creature charmed by the dragon begins its turn, the dragon telepathically commands the charmed creature until the end of the creatures turn. If the dragon commands the creature to take an action that would harm itself or an ally, the creature makes a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creatures turn immediately ends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Charm:</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by the dragon for 24 hours, regarding it as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although it isnt under the dragons control, it takes the dragons requests or actions in the most favorable way it can. At the end of each of the targets turns and at the end of any turn during which the dragon or its companions harmed the target, it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Stupefy:</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.</li>
<li><strong>Psionic Wave (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon uses Psionic Wave.</li>
<li><strong>Captivating Harmonics (1/Day):</strong> Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes psionically charmed by the dragon for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
