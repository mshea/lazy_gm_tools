<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the pact lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>One With Shadows:</strong> As a bonus action when in an area of dim light or darkness, the pact lich can become invisible until it moves or takes an action or reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Patron's Blessing:</strong> When the pact lich reduces a target to 0 hp, the lich gains 25 temporary hp.</li>
<li><strong>Pact Rejuvenation:</strong> If a fist-sized or larger diamond is within its lair, a destroyed pact lich usually gains a new body in 3d10 days, but its return to the Material Plane is ultimately dictated by its patron.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The pact lich's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
At will: chill touch, detect magic, levitate, mage hand, prestidigitation, speak with dead, true strike
1/day each: banishment, bestow curse, compulsion, confusion, conjure elemental, dominate monster, eyebite, finger of death, fly, hellish rebuke (5d10), hold monster, slow</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The pact lich makes four enhanced eldritch blast attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Maddening Touch:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or have vivid hallucinations for 1 minute. During this time, the target is blinded, stunned, and deafened, sensing only the hallucinatory terrain and events. The hallucinations play on aspects of the creature's deepest fears. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Eldritch Blast:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 300 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) force damage. On a successful hit, the pact lich can push the target 10 feet away from it in a straight line.</li>
<li><strong>Hurl Through Hell (1/Day):</strong> The pact lich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target disappears and is paralyzed as it is hurtled through the nightmare landscape of the lower planes. At the end of the pact lich's next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space, and is no longer paralyzed. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage when it returns. The target must succeed on another DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the lich's next turn as the target reels from its horrific experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pact lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>At Will Spell:</strong> The lich casts a spell it can cast at will.</li>
<li><strong>Fiendish Resilience:</strong> The pact lich chooses one damage type, gaining resistance to that damage type until it chooses a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Maddening Touch (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The pact lich uses its Maddening Touch.</li>
<li><strong>Eldritch Master (Costs 3 Actions, 1/Day):</strong> The lich entreats its patron for aid, regaining all expended spells.</li>
