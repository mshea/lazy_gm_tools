<ul>
<li><strong>Skills:</strong> perception +5, stealth +4</li>
<li><strong>Senses:</strong> blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 15</li>
<li><strong>Languages:</strong> —</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The crab can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Living Figureheads:</strong> Three magical figureheads adorn the crab’s back. While at least one figurehead remains intact, the crab has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and can use its Wail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each figurehead is an object with AC 15, 20 hp, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If all the figureheads are reduced to 0 hp, the keelbreaker crab can’t use its Wail action. Damaging a figurehead does not harm the crab.
- <strong>Siege Monster:</strong> The crab deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The crab can use its Wail. It then makes two pincer attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Pincer:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.</li>
<li><strong>Wail:</strong> As long as at least one if its living figureheads remains intact, the keelbreaker crab can cause the figurehead to wail. Roll a d6 and consult the following table to determine the wail.<br/><br/>| d6 | Wail |<br/>|----|------|<br/>| 1-2 | Frightening Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the keelbreaker crab’s Frightening Wail for the next 24 hours. |<br/>| 3-4 | Maddening Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage. |<br/>| 5-6 | Stunning Wail. Each creature within 60 feet who can hear the crab must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. |</li>
