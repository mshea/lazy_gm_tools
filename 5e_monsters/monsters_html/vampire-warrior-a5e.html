<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does so, it visibly grows older. Its original appearance is restored when it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Misty Recovery:</strong> When the vampire drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling unconscious, it turns into mist as if it had used the Mist Form legendary action. It can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to vampire form and is paralyzed for 1 hour, at which time it regains 1 hit point. While paralyzed in this way, it can be destroyed by fire damage, radiant damage, damage from a magical weapon, or a wooden stake driven through the heart, but it is otherwise immune to damage.</li>
<li><strong>Regeneration:</strong> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and hasnt taken radiant damage since its last turn.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The vampire can climb even on difficult surfaces and upside down on ceilings.</li>
<li><strong>Vampire Weaknesses:</strong> Vampires most common weaknesses are sunlight and running water. When the vampire ends its turn in contact with one of its weaknesses (such as being bathed in sunlight or running water), it takes 20 radiant damage. While in contact with its weakness, it can't use its Regeneration trait or its Mist Form or Shapechange actions.</li>
<li><strong>Resting Place:</strong> Every vampires lair contains a resting place, usually a coffin or sarcophagus, where the vampire must rest for at least an hour each day to recuperate its powers. This resting place is sprinkled with soil from its mortal homeland. If this soil is scattered or is subjected to a bless, hallow, or similar spell, the vampire is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab (Vampire Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled in this way.</li>
<li><strong>Charm:</strong> The vampire targets a creature within 30 feet  forcing it to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is charmed by the vampire for 24 hours. While charmed it regards the vampire as a trusted friend and is a willing target for the vampires bite. The target repeats the saving throw each time it takes damage  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the targets saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it  it is immune to this vampires Charm for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Reaping Greatsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit  reach 10 ft.  up to 3 targets. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature  it makes a DC 17 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target that is grappled, incapacitated, restrained, willing, or unaware of the vampires presence. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. The targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage dealt, and the vampire regains this number of hit points. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, it dies and rises the following night as a vampire spawn in the vampires thrall. Before the target first rises as a vampire spawn, a bless, gentle repose, or similar spell cast on the body prevents this transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hissing Scuttle (1/Day):</strong> When the vampire takes radiant damage, it moves up to its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Warding Charm (1/Day):</strong> When a creature the vampire can see targets it with a melee attack but before the attack is made, the vampire uses Charm on that creature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The vampire can take 1 legendary action:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Blood Charm:</strong> The vampire uses Charm. A creature makes its initial saving throw with disadvantage if the vampire has hit it with a bite attack within the last 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Grab:</strong> The vampire makes a grab attack.</li>
<li><strong>Mist Form:</strong> The vampire transforms into a mist or back into its true form. As mist, the vampire has a flying speed of 30, can't speak, can't take actions or manipulate objects, is immune to nonmagical damage from weapons, and has advantage on saving throws and Stealth checks. It can pass through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing but can't pass through water. Anything its carrying transforms with it.</li>
<li><strong>Shapechange:</strong> The vampire transforms into the shape of a Medium or smaller beast or back into its true form. While transformed, it has the beasts size and movement modes. It can't use reactions or legendary actions, and can't speak. Otherwise, it uses the vampires statistics. Anything its carrying transforms with it.</li>
