<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blinding Demise:</strong> When the golem reduces a creature to 0 hp, it can blind the creature permanently. If it does so, the creature is reduced to 1 hp instead.</li>
<li><strong>Construct Nature:</strong> The golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Light-Infused Fists:</strong> The golem’s Slam attacks are magical. When the golem hits with a Slam attack, the attack deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The eye golem can use its Primal Voice of Doom. It then makes two Slam attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.</li>
<li><strong>Gaze of Ancient Light (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The golem opens all of its eyes and emits a burst of blinding light. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t blinded. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Primal Voice of Doom:</strong> The golem intones a disturbing invocation of the sun god at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
