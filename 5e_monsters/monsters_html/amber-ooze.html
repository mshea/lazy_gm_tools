<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Arboreal Movement:</strong> The ooze can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. Creatures preserved inside of it are expelled into unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the tree when the amber ooze moves in this way. The amber ooze can end its turn inside a tree, but it is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the tree if the tree is destroyed.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The amber ooze uses its Engulf. It then makes two pseudopod attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a plant or plant creature, it also takes 3 (1d6) acid damage.</li>
<li><strong>Engulf:</strong> The ooze moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures’ spaces. Whenever the ooze enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.<br/><br/>On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the ooze. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.<br/><br/>On a failed save, the ooze enters the creature’s space and the creature is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is restrained, and, after 1d4 rounds, the creature is petrified. A creature petrified by the ooze remains petrified until 24 hours after it exits the ooze. When the ooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.<br/><br/>An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze.</li>
