<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corruption:</strong> If the külmking moves through another creature, it can use a bonus action to corrupt that creature's soul. The target creature must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. A creature paralyzed by the külmking has disadvantage on this saving throw. </li>
</ul>
<p>On a failed save, a creature suffers from terrible and violent thoughts and tendencies. Over the course of 2d4 days, its alignment shifts to chaotic evil. A creature that dies during this time, or after this shift is complete, rises 24 hours later as a külmking. The corruption can be reversed by a remove curse spell or similar magic used before the creature's death. </p>
<p>On a success, a creature is immune to the külmking's Corruption for the next 24 hours.
- <strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The külmking can pass through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- <strong>Trampling Charge:</strong> If the külmking moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a hooves attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the külmking can make one hooves attack against it as a bonus action.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The külmking makes two claw attacks and one bite or hooves attack.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature that is not undead, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The külmking regains hp equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
<li><strong>Claws:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is not undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Hooves:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</li>
