<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blood Frenzy:</strong> The vile barber has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all its hp.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The vile barber makes two Straight Razor attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or lose 3 (1d6) hp at the start of each of its turns due to a bleeding wound. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.</li>
<li><strong>Straight Razor:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vile barber can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying, provided the item weighs no more than 10 pounds, isn’t a weapon, and isn’t wrapped around or firmly attached to the target, such as a shirt or armor.</li>
<li><strong>Frightening Cut (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The vile barber makes one Straight Razor attack against a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. If the attack hits and deals damage, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and each creature that can see the attack within 15 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hidden Step:</strong> The vile barber magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see and takes the Hide action.</li>
