<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The Queen of Night and Magic makes three Rapier or Star Strike attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting or Unravel.</li>
<li><strong>Rapier:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.</li>
<li><strong>Star Strike:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) fire damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.</li>
<li><strong>Unravel:</strong> The Queen of Night and Magic ends one magical effect she can see within 60 feet of her. To do so, she must succeed on a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level or the magical effect’s DC, whichever is higher.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Rift (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The Queen of Night and Magic creates a shadowy rift on a point she can see within 120 feet. Each creature within the 20 feet of the rift must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) cold damage and 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and is restrained by wisps of icy shadow for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The Queen of Night and Magic casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23):<br/>At will: command, dancing lights, darkness, mage hand, suggestion<br/>3/day each: confusion, fear, greater invisibility, mirror image<br/>1/day each: dominate monster, plane shift, power word stun</li>

<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sudden Fraying:</strong> When the Queen of Night and Magic is targeted by a spell or included in a spell’s area and the spell doesn’t have an instantaneous duration, she can use Unravel on the spell, dispelling it after it is cast. She doesn’t need to see a spell to target it with this reaction, but she must be able to see at least some portion of an area or object affected by the spell.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Queen of Night and Magic can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Queen of Night and Magic regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
