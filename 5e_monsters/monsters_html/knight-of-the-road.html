<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fey Ancestry:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Keen Sight:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Obscure the Way (1/Day):</strong> As a bonus action, the shadow fey designates a creature it can see within 100 feet and obscures the creature and its companions' travel on a particular shadow road. That shadow road will not open for the designated creature or its traveling companions except through powerful magical means such as by a key of Veles. In addition, that shadow road won't lead to its usual destination for the designated creature or its traveling companions, instead leading the group in a meandering loop. This effect lasts for 9 (2d8) days, until the shadow fey removes the effect, or until the shadow fey dies.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Traveler (3/Day):</strong> As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Traveler in Darkness:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.</li>
</ul>

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
