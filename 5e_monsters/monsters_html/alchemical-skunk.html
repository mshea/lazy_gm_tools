<li><strong>Alchemical Spray:</strong> The alchemical skunk raises its tail and sprays an alchemical mixture. The skunk is immune to its own spray effects and to the spray effects of other alchemical skunks. Roll a d6 to determine the skunk’s spray.<br/>1. Pleasant Mist. The skunk produces a rosy mist. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the end of its next turn.<br/>2. Shrinking Cloud. The skunk releases a yellow gas. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be reduced as if targeted by the enlarge/reduce spell for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br/>3. Laughing Gas. The skunk emits a sparkling orange cloud.

Sleeping Fog. The skunk sprays a sweet-smelling blue fog. Each creature within 10 feet of the skunk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
