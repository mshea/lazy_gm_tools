<li><strong>Blur (2nd-Level; V, Concentration):</strong> The lichs form is blurred. Attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage unless the attacker has senses that allow them to perceive without sight or to see through illusions (like blindsight or truesight).</li>

<li><strong>Disintegrate (6th-Level; S, M):</strong> The lich disintegrates a target within 60 feet. A Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force  or a 10-foot-cube section thereof  is automatically destroyed. A creature makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw  taking 75 (10d6 + 40) force damage on a failed save.

<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eldritch Aura:</strong> The lich surrounds itself with a magical, rune-covered, glowing, translucent aura in a 10-foot radius. The aura moves with the lich and casts dim light inside its area. The aura disappears at the beginning of the lichs next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Death Aura:</strong> The aura casts purple light. Each living creature that ends its turn inside the aura takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage, and the lich regains the same number of hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Shield Aura:</strong> The aura casts orange light. It has 35 hit points. Whenever the lich would take damage, the aura takes the damage instead, and the aura visibly weakens. If the damage reduces the aura to 0 hit points, the aura disappears, and the lich takes any excess damage.</li>
<li><strong>Spell Shield Aura:</strong> The aura casts blue light. Any spell cast with a 5th-level or lower spell slot from outside the aura can't affect anything inside the aura. Using a spell to target something inside the aura or include the auras space in an area has no effect on anything inside.</li>
