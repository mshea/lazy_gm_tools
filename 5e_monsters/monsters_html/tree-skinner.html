<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>False Appearance (Tree Form Only):</strong> While the skinner remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.</li>
<li><strong>Inhabit Tree:</strong> As a bonus action, the skinner touches a Medium or larger tree that is not a creature and disappears inside it. While inside the tree, the skinner has tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, has an AC of 15, has a speed of 0, and has vulnerability to fire damage. When the skinner is reduced to 15 hp, the tree dies and the skinner appears within 5 feet of the dead tree or in the nearest unoccupied space. The skinner can exit the tree as a bonus action, appearing within 5 feet of the tree in the nearest unoccupied space, and the tree reverts to being an object. The skinner can inhabit a tree for only 3 days at most before the tree dies, requiring the skinner to seek another vessel.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The skinner has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Vine Whip (Tree Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). The skinner can grapple up to two creatures at one time.</li>
<li><strong>Squeeze (Tree Form Only):</strong> The tree skinner makes one vine whip attack against a creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also unable to breathe or cast spells with verbal components until this grapple ends.</li>
