<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assassinate:</strong> During its first turn, the shadow fey has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the poisoner scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.</li>
<li><strong>Born of Shadows:</strong> When in dim light or darkness, the shadow fey poisoner is invisible.</li>
<li><strong>Evasion:</strong> If the shadow fey poisoner is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the poisoner instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</li>
<li><strong>Fey Ancestry:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Traveler (4/Day):</strong> As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.</li>
<li><strong>Sneak Attack (1/Turn):</strong> The shadow fey poisoner deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll; or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the poisoner, that ally isn't incapacitated, and the poisoner doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Traveler in Darkness:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The shadow fey poisoner makes two shortsword attacks or two longbow attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Shortsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Longbow:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
