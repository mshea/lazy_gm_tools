<li><strong>Draconic Visage (1/Day):</strong> The wizard kobold magically creates a draconic visage in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The visage is a glowing, spectral head and neck, resembling a variety of dragon chosen by the kobold, that sheds dim light out to 10 feet. The visage lasts for 1 minute and grants the following benefits: <br/><em> A creature hostile to the wizard who starts its turn within 30 feet of the visage and who is aware of the visage must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. <br/></em> The wizard gains immunity to the damage type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon. <br/>* When the wizard uses this action, and as a bonus action on it subsequent turns, it can use the following attack:</li>
<li><strong>Breath of the Visage:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) damage of the type dealt by the chosen dragon's breath weapon.</li>
