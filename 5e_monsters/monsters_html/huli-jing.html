<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shapechanger:</strong> The huli jing can use its action to polymorph into a Medium female human of unearthly beauty, or back into its true, nine-tailed fox form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The huli jing’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components.
At will: charm person, invisibility (self only), major image
3/day each: cure wounds, disguise self, fear
2/day each: bestow curse, confusion
1/day each: divination, modify memory</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> In fox form, the huli jing uses Curse of Luck then makes two bite attacks. In humanoid form, it uses Curse of Luck then makes three jade dagger attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite (True Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 911 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage and 14 (4d6) psychic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Jade Dagger (Humanoid Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) psychic damage</li>
<li><strong>Curse of Luck:</strong> Each creature of the huli jing’s choice within 60 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the huli jing’s Curse of Luck for the next 24 hours. Alternatively, the huli jing can choose up to three willing creatures within 60 feet of it. Each target has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute.</li>
<li><strong>Draining Glance (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The huli jing draws sustenance from the psyches of living creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area that isn’t a construct or an undead must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The huli jing regains hp equal to the single highest amount of psychic damage dealt.</li>
