Grazer can have only one creature absorbed at a time. If grazer takes 10+ damage on a single turn from absorbed creature grazer must make DC 15 Con save at end of that turn or expel the creature which falls prone in a space within 5 ft. of grazer. If grazer is flying expelled creature takes normal fall damage. If grazer dies absorbed creature no longer restrained but has disadvantage on save vs. grazer Death Spores.</li>
