<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The goo can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Deadly to Fey:</strong> The goo has advantage on attack rolls against fey and any creature with the Fey Ancestry trait.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The goo can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The Yaga goo makes two pseudopod attacks. When its Foul Transit is available, it can use Foul Transit in place of one pseudopod attack.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Foul Transit (Recharge 4-6):</strong> The goo teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 50 feet, leaving behind a wretched puddle in the space it previously occupied. A creature within 5 feet of the space the goo left must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. The first time a creature enters the puddle's space or if a creature starts its turn in the puddle's space it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned. The puddle lasts for 1 minute or until the goo that created it is killed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puddle Splash:</strong> When a creature the Yaga goo can see targets it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the goo, the goo can teleport to a puddle created by its Foul Transit, if that puddle's space is unoccupied, negating the damage from the attack. If it does, the attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.</li>
