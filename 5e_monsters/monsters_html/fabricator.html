<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assemble:</strong> With at least 10 minutes of work, a fabricator can refine raw materials and create entirely new objects by combining material it has absorbed. For example, it can create a rope from absorbed hemp, clothing from absorbed flax or wool, and a longsword from absorbed metal. A fabricator can create intricate objects like thieves’ tools and objects with moving parts with at least 1 hour of work and twice the requisite raw materials, but it can’t create magic items. The quality of objects it creates is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</li>
<li><strong>Dismantling Form:</strong> A creature that touches the fabricator or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) force damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or once-living material (such as bone or wood) that hits the fabricator is slowly dismantled by the minute constructs that make up the fabricator. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or once-living material that hits the fabricator is destroyed after dealing damage. At the start of each of its turns, the fabricator can choose whether this trait is active.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The fabricator makes two disassembling slam attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Disassembling Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) force damage. A creature reduced to 0 hp by this attack immediately dies and its body and nonmagical equipment is disassembled and absorbed into the fabricator. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. The fabricator can choose to not disassemble a creature or its equipment after reducing it to 0 hp.</li>
