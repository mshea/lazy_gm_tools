<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apothecary:</strong> At the start of each of the kobold alchemist’s turns, the alchemist chooses one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The alchemist has resistance to that damage type until the start of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> The kobold has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the kobold’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The kobold makes two Alchemical Dagger or Alchemical Bolt attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Alchemical Dagger:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) damage of the type determined by Apothecary.</li>
<li><strong>Alchemical Bolt:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) damage of the type determined by Apothecary.</li>
<li><strong>Alchemical Vapors (Recharge 6):</strong> The kobold alchemist releases alchemical vapors pleasing to draconic senses and unpleasant to all others. Each creature that isn’t a dragonborn or kobold within 15 feet of the alchemist must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each dragonborn and kobold within 15 feet of the alchemist has resistance to damage of the type determined by Apothecary for 1 minute.</li>
<li><strong>Explosive Flask (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The kobold alchemist throws a flask of volatile substances at a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The flask explodes, and each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) damage of the type determined by Apothecary and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
