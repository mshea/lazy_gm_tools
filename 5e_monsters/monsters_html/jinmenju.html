<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Burrowing Roots:</strong> Whenever the jinmenju makes a root attack, it can choose a point on the ground within 120 feet of it. The root bursts from the ground, and that point becomes the attack's point of origin. After attacking, the exposed root protrudes from that point, and the jinmenju gains a reaction each turn that it can only use to make an opportunity attack with that root. A root has AC 15, 45 hp, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Damaging a root doesn't damage the jinmenju tree. The jinmenju can have up to 5 roots active at one time. If it makes a root attack while it has 5 roots active, one of the active roots burrows back into the ground and a new root appears at the location of the new attack.</li>
<li><strong>Laughing Fruit:</strong> If a creature with Intelligence 5 or higher eats a bite of the fruit of the jinmenju, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated by fits of laughter as it perceives everything as hilariously funny for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target takes damage while prone, it has advantage on the saving throw.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The jinmenju makes two root attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Root:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The jinmenju can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The jinmenju regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root:</strong> The jimenju makes one root attack.</li>
<li><strong>Revitalize Roots:</strong> The jinmenju restores 10 (3d6) hp to each of its exposed roots.</li>
<li><strong>Mirthful Miasma (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The jinmenju emits a puff of purple gas around its roots. Each creature within 10 feet of an exposed root must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall prone with laughter, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up until the end of its next turn. A creature in an area of overlapping gas only makes the saving throw once. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.</li>
