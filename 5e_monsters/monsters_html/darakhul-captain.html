<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Master of Disguise:</strong> A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its Stench.</li>
<li><strong>Necrotic Weapons:</strong> The darakhul captain’s weapon attacks are magical. When the captain hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Stench:</strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Defiance:</strong> The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The darakhul captain makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, and one with its longsword. Alternatively, it can make four attacks with its longsword.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid is paralyzed for more than 2 rounds, it contracts darakhul fever.</li>
<li><strong>Longsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Crossbow:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial Conscription (Recharge 6):</strong> The darakhul captain targets one incapacitated creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the victim has darakhul fever, this reduction can’t be removed until the victim recovers from the disease. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises as a ghast 1d4 hours later under the darakhul captain’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life</li>
<li><strong>Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):</strong> For 1 minute, the darakhul captain can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the captain. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the captain is incapacitated.</li>
