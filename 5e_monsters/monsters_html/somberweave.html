<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow Webs:</strong> The somberweave’s webs are anchored in the Material Plane and the Shadow Realm, existing in both simultaneously. Except for effects and attacks from the somberweave, a creature in contact with or restrained by a somberweave’s webs has half cover and is immune to any spell or effect that would move it to a different plane, such as the banishment and plane shift spells.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Sight:</strong> The somberweave can see 60 feet into the Shadow Realm when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The somberweave can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
<li><strong>Web Sense:</strong> While in contact with a web, the somberweave knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.</li>
<li><strong>Web Walker:</strong> The somberweave ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The somberweave makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Claws:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Web (Recharge 5-6):</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 10; vulnerability to radiant damage; immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, poison, and psychic damage).</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Shift:</strong> The somberweave touches a creature restrained by its webbing and transports itself and the creature into the Shadow Realm or the Material Plane, the somberweave’s choice. The somberweave and the target appear within 5 feet of each other in unoccupied spaces in the chosen plane. The destination location must be within 10 feet of the somberweave’s anchored web. If the target is unwilling, it can make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the somberweave is transported but the target isn’t.</li>
