<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fleshbag:</strong> The behemoth starts with two arms and two legs. If it loses one arm, it can't multiattack. If it loses both arms, it can't slam. If it loses one leg, its speed is halved. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.</li>
<li><strong>Flesh Wound:</strong> At the end of any turn in which the behemoth took at least 30 damage, roll a d8. On a 1, it loses an arm. On a 2, it loses a leg. In addition, 2 (1d4) zombies fall prone in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the behemoth, spilling from the wound.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Defiance:</strong> The grave behemoth and any zombies within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.</li>
<li><strong>Zombie Keeper:</strong> Zombies created by a grave behemoth's Flesh Wound and Hurl Flesh share a telepathic link with it, are under its control, are immune to necrotic damage, and act immediately and on the grave behemoth's initiative.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The grave behemoth makes two slam attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Gorge:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Hurl Flesh (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The grave behemoth vomits putrid flesh and 5 (2d4) zombies in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 38 (11d6) necrotic damage and is covered in rotting slime for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the necrotic damage and isn't covered in slime. A creature, including the target, can take an action to clean off the slime. Zombies under the grave behemoth's control have advantage on attack rolls against creatures covered in a grave behemoth's slime.</li>
