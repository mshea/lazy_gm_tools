<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The dragon can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Flowing Grace:</strong> The dragon doesnt provoke opportunity attacks when it flies or swims out of an enemys reach.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it loses coordination as white-crested waves run up and down its body. It loses its Flowing Grace and Shimmering Scales traits until the beginning of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Shimmering Scales:</strong> While in water, the dragon gains three-quarters cover from attacks made by creatures more than 30 feet away.</li>
<li><strong>Essence Link:</strong> The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 20). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:create or destroy water, fog cloud, control water, freedom of movement,  1/day each:control weather, wall of ice</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Torrential Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales water in a 90-foot-long  10-foot-wide line. Each creature in the area makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw  taking 66 (19d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also knocked prone and is pushed up to 60 feet away. A creature that impacts a solid object takes an extra 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>

Creatures in the area make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and pushed up to 15 feet. On a failure, a creature takes half damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>

Vehicles moved in this way have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. Creatures that impact a solid object take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Sudden Maelstrom (While Bloodied:</strong> The dragon magically surrounds itself with a 60-foot-radius maelstrom of surging wind and rain for 1 minute.
