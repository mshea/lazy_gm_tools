<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arcane Wasting:</strong> Characterized by the slow mental deterioration it causes, arcane wasting is a disease that infects Humanoids and spreads through spellcasting. A creature infected with this disease manifests symptoms 1d4 days after infection, which include brain fog and difficulty recalling memories. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its Intelligence and Wisdom scores are each reduced by 1d2. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces a creature’s Intelligence or Wisdom to 0, the creature dies. If the infected creature casts a spell on a Humanoid before the disease is cured, and the Humanoid is hit by the spell or fails the saving throw, that Humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the arcane wasting disease.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The white ape has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting Animosity:</strong> If the white ape sees a creature cast a spell, the ape has advantage on attack rolls against that creature on the ape’s next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The white ape makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract the arcane wasting disease (see the Arcane Wasting trait).</li>
<li><strong>Fist:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Frenzy (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The white ape lashes out wildly at nearby creatures, flailing and biting. Each creature within 10 feet of the white ape must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the ape. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw also has advantage on attack rolls against the white ape until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Familiar:</strong> The witchlight can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the witchlight senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the witchlight is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion can’t be blinded. At any time and for any reason, the witchlight can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.</li>
