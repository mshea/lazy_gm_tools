While harpoon is stuck target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at start of each of its turns hunter can’t make Harpoon attacks vs. other targets and target and hunter can’t move further than 60' away from each other. A creature including target can take its action to detach harpoon by succeeding on a DC 17 Str check.
