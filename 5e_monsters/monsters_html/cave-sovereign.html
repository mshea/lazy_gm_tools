<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deathlights:</strong> When a creature that can see sovereigh's glowing antennae starts its turn within 30' of it sovereign can force it to make a DC 18 Wis save if sovereign isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If save fails by 5+ creature is stunned until the start of its next turn. Otherwise creature that fails is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until start of its next turn as it remains transfixed in place by the lights. Unless surprised creature can avert its eyes to avoid the save at start of its turn. If creature does so it can’t see sovereign until start of its next turn when it can avert again. If creature looks at sovereign in the meantime it must immediately save.</li>
<li><strong>Illumination:</strong> Its antennae shed dim light in a 5 ft. radius. Radius increases to 20' while at least one creature is incapacitated or stunned by Deathlights. At start of its turn if no creatures are incapacitated or stunned by Deathlights sovereign can suppress this light until start of its next turn.</li>
