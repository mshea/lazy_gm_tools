<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clockwork Encasement:</strong> The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a variety of manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. When the ahu-nixta is reduced to 0 hp, its clockwork armor breaks and the ahu-nixta exits it. Once out of its armor, the creature’s pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta’s body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can’t be used for combat. The ahu-nixta’s extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor. </p>
<p>The ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action.
- <strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The ahu-nixta’s clockwork armor is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as is the creature that controls it as long as the ahu-nixta remains within the armor.
- <strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The ahu-nixta’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The ahu-nixta can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: fear, fire bolt (2d10), telekinesis</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The cataphract makes three melee attacks. It can cast one at will spell in place of two melee attacks. Alternatively, it can use its Arcane Cannon twice.</li>
<li><strong>Whirring Blades:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d4 + 5) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (2d4) slashing damage at the start of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Pronged Scepter:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Bashing Rod:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage</li>
<li><strong>Arcane Cannon:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 100 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (4d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
