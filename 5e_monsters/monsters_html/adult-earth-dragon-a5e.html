<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earth Glide:</strong> The dragon can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing it.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While the dragon remains motionless within its linked area, it is indistinguishable from a natural rocky outcropping.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it becomes more like rock. Its movement is halved until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Essence Link:</strong> The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:locate animals or plants, spike growth, stone shape, wall of stone</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its slam. In place of its bite attack  it can use Rock Spire.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit  reach 10 ft.  one target. Hit: 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage. Instead of dealing piercing damage  the dragon can grapple the target (escape DC 20)  and a Large or smaller creature grappled in this way is restrained. While grappling a creature  the dragon can't bite another target.</li>
<li><strong>Slam:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Scouring Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales scouring sand and stones in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw  taking 56 (16d6) slashing damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the save is also blinded until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Rock Spire:</strong> A permanent  25-foot-tall  5-foot-radius spire of rock magically rises from a point on the ground within 60 feet. A creature in the spires area when it appears makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw  taking 13 (3d8) piercing damage on a failure or half damage on a success. A creature that fails this saving throw by 10 or more is impaled at the top of the spire. A creature can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength check  freeing the implaced creature on a success. The impaled creature is also freed if the spire is destroyed. The spire is an object with AC 16  30 hit points and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Shake the Foundation:</strong> The dragon causes the ground to roil, creating a permanent, 40-foot-radius area of difficult terrain centered on a point the dragon can see. If the dragon is bloodied, creatures in the area make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling prone on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Slam Attack (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon makes a slam attack.</li>
<li><strong>Entomb (While Bloodied:</strong> The dragon targets a creature on the ground within 60 feet, forcing it to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is magically entombed 5 feet under the earth. While entombed, the target is blinded, restrained, and can't breathe. A creature can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing an entombed creature on a success.</li>
