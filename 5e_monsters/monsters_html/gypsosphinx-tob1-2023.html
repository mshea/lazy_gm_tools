<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death Sense:</strong> The sphinx can pinpoint, by scent, the location of each creature below half its hp maximum within 60 feet of it, and it can sense the general direction of creatures that don’t have all of their hp within 1 mile of it. In addition, the sphinx can foretell the age and manner of a creature’s death by looking at it. This effect doesn’t take into account possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of powerful spells or the creature making a radical change in its life’s path.</li>
<li><strong>Inscrutable:</strong> The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the sphinx’s intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Weapons:</strong> The sphinx’s weapon attacks are magical.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The sphinx makes one Beak attack and two Claw attacks. If both Claw attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 14 (4d6) slashing damage and be knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Beak:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Carrion Breath (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The gypsosphinx exhales rotting breath in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on death saving throws. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The sphinx casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):<br/>At will: comprehend languages, detect magic, mage hand<br/>3/day each: blur, dispel magic, locate object<br/>1/day each: major image, greater invisibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The sphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The sphinx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beak Attack:</strong> The sphinx makes one Beak attack.</li>
<li><strong>Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The sphinx uses Spellcasting.</li>
<li><strong>Teleport (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</li>
