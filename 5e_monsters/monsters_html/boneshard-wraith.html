<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The boneshard wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The wraith makes two spectral claw attacks. If both attacks damage the same creature, the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spectral Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1 level of exhaustion. A creature can suffer no more than 2 levels of exhaustion from the wraith’s Spectral Claws.</li>
<li><strong>Boneshard Cyclone (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The wraith chooses a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 20 (3d12) slashing damage and 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is enveloped in a whirlwind of sharp bone fragments for 1 minute or until the wraith dies. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t enveloped. While enveloped, a creature is blinded and deafened and takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature dies while enveloped, it rises as a boneshard wraith on the next new moon unless it is restored to life or the bless spell is cast on the remains.</li>
