<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fey Ancestry:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Traveler (1/Day):</strong> As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Traveler in Darkness:</strong> The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The pattern dancer is a 5th-levelspellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): dancing lights, friends, minor illusion, poison spray
1st level (4 slots): color spray, disguise self, magic missile, shield
2nd level (3 slots): blur, mirror image
3rd level (2 slots): major image, nondetection</li>
<li><strong>Group Actions:</strong> When three pattern dancers are within 60 feet of each other, they can work together to cast communal spells that are more powerful than they could cast individually. To do this, one takes an action to cast a spell, and the other two must use their reactions to complete it. These communal spells are cast at 11th level and have a spell save DC of 13:
At will: hold person
3/day: fear, sleep
1/day: confusion, hypnotic pattern</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
