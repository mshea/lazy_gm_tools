<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amend Time:</strong> As a bonus action, the savant alters the strands of time surrounding a creature it can see within 30 feet. If the target is friendly, the target has advantage on its next weapon attack roll. If the target is hostile, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on its next weapon attack roll.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The savant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Past and Future, Present:</strong> A savant is always accompanied by its past and future selves. They occupy the savant’s same space seconds before and after the savant and can’t be targeted separately. They provide the savant with the following benefits. </li>
<li>The savant can concentrate on two spells simultaneously. If it casts a third spell that requires concentration, the savant loses concentration on the oldest spell. If the savant is concentrating on two spells and loses concentration because of taking damage, it loses concentration on the oldest spell.</li>
<li>When a creature targets the savant with an attack, roll a d6. On a 1 through 4, the attack hits one of the savant’s future or past selves, halving the damage the savant takes. On a 5 or 6, the attack hits the savant, and it takes damage as normal. The savant is still the target of the attack and is subject to effects that trigger when a creature is hit or damaged.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The savant is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The savant has the following wizard spells prepared: Cantrips (at will): fire bolt, light, mage hand, prestidigitation

2nd Level (3 slots): enlarge/reduce, gust of wind, misty step
