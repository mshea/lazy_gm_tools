<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gullible:</strong> The giant makes Insight checks with disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The giant attacks twice with its greatclub.</li>
<li><strong>Greatclub:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.</li>
<li><strong>Rock:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (6d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. In lieu of a rock  the giant can throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 30 feet. On a hit  the target and the thrown creature both take 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. On a miss  only the thrown creature takes the damage. The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.</li>
<li><strong>Greatclub Sweep (1/Day, While Bloodied):</strong> Each creature within 10 feet makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure  a creature takes 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage  is pushed 10 feet away from the giant  and falls prone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab:</strong> One creature within 5 feet makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the giant can't grab another target, and it makes greatclub attacks with advantage against the grappled target.</li>
<li><strong>Body Slam (1/Day):</strong> The giant jumps up to 15 feet horizontally without provoking opportunity attacks and falls prone in a space containing one or more creatures. Each creature in its space when it lands makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet to an unoccupied space of its choice. If that space is occupied, the creature falls prone.</li>
<li><strong>Muddy Ground (1/Day):</strong> Areas of unworked earth within 60 feet magically become swampy mud for 1 minute or until the giant dies. These areas become difficult terrain. Prone creatures in the area when the mud appears or that fall prone in the area make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creatures Speed drops to 0 as it becomes stuck in the mud. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Stomp (1/Day):</strong> The giant stamps its foot, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature within 60 feet makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.</li>
