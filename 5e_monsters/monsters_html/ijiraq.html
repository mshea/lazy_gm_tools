<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magic Weapons:</strong> The ijiraq's weapon attacks are magical.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Loss:</strong> After encountering an ijiraq, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to remember the events. On a failure, the details of the encounter rapidly fade away from the creature's mind, including the presence of the ijiraq.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> In its true form, the ijiraq makes two claw attacks. In its hybrid form, it makes one gore attack and one claw attack.</li>
<li><strong>Gore (Hybrid Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) poison damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw (Hybrid Form or True Form Only):</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage. Invisibility (True Form Only). The ijiraq magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). It may choose whether equipment it wears or carries is invisible with it or not.</li>
<li><strong>Change Shape:</strong> The ijiraq magically polymorphs into any beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, into its caribou-human hybrid form, or back into its true from. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the ijiraq's choice). <br/><br/>While in its true form or its hybrid form, its statistics are the same. When in a beast form, the ijiraq retains its alignment, hp, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</li>
