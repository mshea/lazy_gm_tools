<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innate spells:</strong> The shadow elf magecan innately cast dancing lights as a cantrip and faerie fire and darkness once each per long rest with no material components, using Intelligence as their spellcasting ability.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The mage is a 9th level spellcaster. Their spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14

 Cantrips (at will): fire bolt
 light
 mage hand
 prestidigitation

 shield
 2nd-level (3 slots): alter self
 misty step
 3rd-level (3 slots): clairvoyance
 counterspell
 lightning bolt
 4th-level (3 slots): dimension door

 5th-level (1 slot): cloudkill</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dagger:</strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Bolt (Cantrip; V, S):</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d10) fire damage.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S, M):</strong> A bolt of lightning 5 feet wide and 100 feet long arcs from the mage. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw  taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Dimension Door (4th-Level; V):</strong> The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails.</li>
<li><strong>Greater Invisibility (4th-Level; V, S, Concentration):</strong> The mage or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 minute.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudkill (5th-Level; V, S, Concentration):</strong> A 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous  sickly green fog appears centered on a point within 120 feet. It lasts for 10 minutes. It spreads around corners  heavily obscures the area  and can be dispersed by a strong wind  ending the spell early. Until the spell ends  when a creature starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on a turn  it makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 22 (5d8) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The fog moves away from the mage 10 feet at the start of each of its turns  sinking to the level of the ground in that space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):</strong> The mage teleports to an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet. The mage can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Counterspell (3rd-Level; S):</strong> When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell.</li>
<li><strong>Shield (1st-Level; V:</strong> When the mage is hit by an attack or targeted by magic missile, they gain a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to magic missile. These benefits last until the start of their next turn.</li>
