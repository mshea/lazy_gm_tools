<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ambusher:</strong> The ooze has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.</li>
<li><strong>Amorphous:</strong> The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.</li>
<li><strong>Corrosive Form:</strong> A creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the ooze is coated in a corrosive red slime. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.</li>
<li><strong>False Appearance:</strong> While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of rubies.</li>
<li><strong>Spider Climb:</strong> The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The ruby ooze makes two pseudopod attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudopod:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) acid damage.</li>
<li><strong>Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The ooze sprays its bright red protoplasm in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and is restrained as its flesh begins to turn into a translucent ruby-like stone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. The restrained creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage and becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.</li>
