<li><strong>Keen Hearing and Smell:</strong> The werewolf has advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or smell.</li>
<li><strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> The werewolf has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the werewolfs allies is within 5 feet of the creature and not incapacitated.</li>
<li><strong>Wolfsbane:</strong> Lycanthropes are repelled by the wolfsbane flower. A lycanthrope in hybrid or beast form is poisoned while within 10 feet of a living or dried wolfsbane flower that it can smell. If wolfsbane is applied to a weapon or ammunition, lycanthropes are damaged by the weapon as if it were silver. An application of wolfsbane lasts for 1 hour.</li>
<li><strong>Cursed Wounds:</strong> Each of the werewolfs claw and bite attacks deals an additional 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the targets hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.</li>
