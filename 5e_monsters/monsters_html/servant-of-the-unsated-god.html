<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inescapable Hunger:</strong> Necrotic damage dealt by the servant of the Unsated God ignores resistance to necrotic damage.</li>
<li><strong>Master of Disguise:</strong> A servant in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, it loses its stench.</li>
<li><strong>Stench:</strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the servant must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the servant’s Stench for the next 24 hours. A servant using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.</li>
<li><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity:</strong> While in sunlight, the servant has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li><strong>Turning Defiance:</strong> The servant and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The servant of the Unsated God is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following cleric spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): guidance, mending, resistance, thaumaturgy
1st level (4 slots): bane, command, inflict wounds, protection from evil and good
2nd level (3 slots): blindness/deafness, hold person, spiritual weapon</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The servant of the Unsated God makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its mace of the devourer.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and, if the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract darakhul fever.</li>
<li><strong>Mace of the Devourer:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The mace is magical and infused with the Unsated God’s power while in the servant’s hands.</li>
<li><strong>Light Crossbow:</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Hungering Strike (Recharge 5-6):</strong> A shadowy jaw superimposes over the servant of the Unsated God’s mouth and reaches out to a creature within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
