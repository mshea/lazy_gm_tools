<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypnotic Plumage:</strong> When a creature that can see the sunset raptor's tail starts its turn within 100 feet of the raptor, the raptor can force it to make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw if the raptor isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature becomes charmed until the start of its next turn. While charmed, the creature is incapacitated as it suffers from surreal hallucinations and must move up to its speed closer to the raptor that charmed it. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the sunset raptor, a target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Other sunset raptors are immune to this effect. </li>
</ul>
<p>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the sunset raptor until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the sunset raptor in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
- <strong>Pack Tactics:</strong> The sunset raptor has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the raptor's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The sunset raptor makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.</li>

<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage</li>
