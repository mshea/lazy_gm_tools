<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ice Climb:</strong> When climbing on ice, the Snow Queen has a climbing speed of 20 feet, and she can climb difficult surfaces made of ice and snow, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</li>
<li><strong>Icy Weapons:</strong> The Snow Queen’s weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 cold damage (included in the attack).</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the Snow Queen fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>Snowsight:</strong> The Snow Queen can see through areas obscured by snowfall, sleet, rain, and other wintry precipitation without penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Snow Walk:</strong> The Snow Queen can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost her extra movement.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The Snow Queen makes two Claw or Ice Bolt attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.</li>
<li><strong>Ice Bolt:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage. The target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Snap (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The Snow Queen causes the temperature around her to drop dramatically. Each creature without 30 feet of the Snow Queen must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer exhaustion. A creature that is immune to cold damage doesn’t suffer exhaustion, even if it fails the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified in ice for 1 minute. A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A petrified creature that takes fire damage has advantage on the saving throw to end the effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Snow Queen can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Snow Queen regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack:</strong> The Snow Queen makes a Claw or Ice Bolt attack.</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> The Snow Queen moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Snowblind:</strong> One creature the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded by swirling snow until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Wintry Swirl (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> Each creature within 15 feet of the Snow Queen must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have vulnerability to cold damage until the end of its next turn. A creature with immunity to cold damage that fails this saving throw instead loses its immunity to cold damage but isn’t vulnerable to it.</li>
