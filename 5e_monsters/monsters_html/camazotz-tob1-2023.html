<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> Camazotz makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 38 (8d6 + 10) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A Humanoid that dies from this reduction rises 1d4 days later as a vampire under Camazotz’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Camazotz can have no more than five vampires under his control at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d6 + 10) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.</li>
<li><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6):</strong> Camazotz exhales unholy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage and 33 (6d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Call Bats (3/Day):</strong> Camazotz magically calls 4d6 giant bats or swarms of bats, or he magically calls 2d6 vrocks that have membranous instead of feathered wings. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Camazotz and obeying his telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until Camazotz dies, or until Camazotz dismisses them as a bonus action. Camazotz can have no more than twenty four giant bats or swarms of bats, or twelve vrocks under his control at a time.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
