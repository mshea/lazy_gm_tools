<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The boloti can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Water Camouflage:</strong> The boloti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while at least half of its body is submerged in water.</li>
<li><strong>Water Mastery:</strong> A boloti has advantage on attack rolls if both it and its target are touching the same body of water. If the target and the boloti are both on dry ground, the boloti has disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
<li><strong>Watery Body (Vortex Form Only):</strong> The boloti can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that starts its turn in the boloti’s space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or take 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage as it is buffeted by the swirl of water.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Dagger (True Form Only):</strong> Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Whirlpool (Vortex Form Only):</strong> One creature in the boloti’s space must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage, and if it is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the damage and is pushed out of the boloti’s space.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> (True Form Only)The boloti casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 11):<br/>At will: water breathing, water walk<br/>3/day each: create or destroy water, fog cloud, sleep<br/>1/day: control water</li>

The boloti can transform into its vortex form only while at least half of its body is submerged in water, and any creature it is grappling with Whirlpool is freed if the boloti transforms back to its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
