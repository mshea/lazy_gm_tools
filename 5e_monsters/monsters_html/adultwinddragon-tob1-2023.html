</ul>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom of Movement:</strong> The dragon ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can’t reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>Storm Sight:</strong> The dragon can see through areas obscured by fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation.</li>
<li><strong>Whirling Winds:</strong> Gale force winds rage around the dragon’s body. Ranged weapon attack rolls against the dragon have disadvantage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The wind dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Tail:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.</li>
<li><strong>Frightful Presence:</strong> Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Tempest Breath (Recharge 5–6):</strong> The dragon exhales a blast of stormy wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and 27 (6d8) lightning damage and is pushed up to 30 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone. Unprotected flames, such as torches, in the area are extinguished, and protected flames, such as those in lanterns, have a 75 percent chance of being extinguished.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect:</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack:</strong> The dragon makes a Tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
