<li><strong>Forbiddance:</strong> The nagas lair is under the forbiddance spell. Until it is dispelled, creatures in the lair can't teleport or use planar travel. Fiends and undead that are not the nagas allies take 27 (5d10) radiant damage when they enter or start their turn in the lair.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 35 (10d6) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Spit Poison:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit  range 20/60 ft.  one creature. Hit: The target makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw  taking 35 (10d6) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Command (1st-Level; V):</strong> One living creature within 60 feet that the naga can see and that can hear and understand it makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target uses its next turn to move as far from the naga as possible  avoiding hazardous terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Hold Person (2nd-Level; V, Concentration):</strong> One humanoid the naga can see within 60 feet makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure  the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li><strong>Flame Strike (5th-Level; V):</strong> A column of divine flame fills a 10-foot-radius  40-foot-high cylinder within 60 feet. Creatures in the area make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw  taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failure or half damage on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shapeshift:</strong> The naga changes its form to that of a specific Medium humanoid, a Medium snake-human hybrid with the lower body of a snake, or its true form, which is a Large snake. While shapeshifted, its statistics are unchanged except for its size. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</li>
