<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>Rejuvenation:</strong> If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.</li>
<li><strong>Turn Resistance:</strong> The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.</li>
<li><strong>Versatile Artist:</strong> At the end of each long rest, the lich chooses one form of artistic expression, such as song, poetry, dance, fashion, paint, or similar. Until it finishes a long rest, the lich has immunity to one type of damage, which is associated with its artistic expression. For example, a lich expressing art through song or poetry has immunity to thunder damage, a lich expressing art through fashion has immunity to slashing damage, and a lich expressing art through paint has immunity to acid damage. This trait can’t give the lich immunity to force, psychic, or radiant damage.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The virtuoso lich is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following bard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): mage hand, message, true strike, vicious mockery
1st level (4 slots): bane, hideous laughter, thunderwave
2nd level (3 slots): enthrall, hold person, invisibility, shatter
3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, fear, speak with dead
4th level (3 slots): compulsion, confusion, dimension door
5th level (2 slots): dominate person, mislead
6th level (1 slot): irresistible dance, programmed illusion</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The virtuoso lich uses its Corrupted Art. It then makes two Artistic Flourish attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Artistic Flourish:</strong> Melee Spell Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait.</li>
<li><strong>Corrupted Art:</strong> The lich hums a discordant melody, paints a crumbling symbol of death in the air, performs a reality-bending pirouette, or emulates some other expression of corrupted or twisted art and targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. This action’s effects change, depending on if the target is undead. <br/><em> Non-Undead. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. <br/></em> Undead. The target regains 18 (4d8) hit points. Healing that exceeds the target’s hp maximum becomes temporary hit points.</li>
<li><strong>Call Muse:</strong> The lich targets one humanoid or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lich for 1 minute. The charmed target, the lich’s “muse,” has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated as it watches or listens to the lich’s artistic expression. The muse can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich’s Call Muse for the next 24 hours. If the muse suffers harm from the lich, it is no longer charmed.<br/><br/>The lich can have only one muse at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous muse ends. If the lich is within 30 feet of its muse and can see its muse, the lich has advantage on its first Artistic Flourish attack each round against a creature that isn’t its muse.</li>
</ul>
<p>The virtuoso lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artistic Flourish:</strong> The lich makes one Artistic Flourish attack.</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> The lich moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions):</strong> The lich casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.</li>
<li><strong>Unrestrained Art (Costs 3 Actions):</strong> The lich unleashes the full force of its artistic talents on those nearby. Each creature with 10 feet of the lich must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) damage of the type chosen with the Versatile Artist trait and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone.</li>
