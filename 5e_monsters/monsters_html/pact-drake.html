<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Binding Witness:</strong> Creatures that make a pact or agree to terms while the drake witnesses the agreement are bound by the drake's magic. They have disadvantage on saving throws against scrying by the drake (simply making a successful save against the drake's scrying usually is enough to arouse its suspicion), and they become potential targets for the drake's Punish Transgressor action.</li>
<li><strong>Sense Falsehood:</strong> The drake knows if it hears a lie.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> A pact drake's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can cast the following spells, requiring only somatic components:
At will: detect magic
3/day each: arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The pact drake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.</li>
<li><strong>Claw:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Bite:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</li>
<li><strong>Enforced Diplomacy (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The pact drake breathes a calming haze in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, a creature also can't attack up to five creatures of the pact drake's choice. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.</li>
<li><strong>Punish Transgressor:</strong> The drake targets a single creature within 60 feet that broke the terms of a pact witnessed by the drake. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1d6 minutes. The conditions can be ended early only with a dispel magic (DC 15) spell or similar magic. When these conditions end, the affected creature has disadvantage on saving throws until it finishes a long rest.</li>
