<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amphibious:</strong> The River King can breathe air and water.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> If the River King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.</li>
<li><strong>Riparian Weapons:</strong> The River King’s weapon attacks are magical. When he hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 10 (3d6) poison damage (included in the attack).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The River King makes two Longsword or Flood Blast attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Longsword:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.</li>
<li><strong>Flood Blast:</strong> Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (4d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away from the River King and knocked prone.</li>
<li><strong>Grasping Whirlpool (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The River King magically creates a swirling vortex of water centered on a point he can see within 60 feet. The vortex appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 15 feet tall with a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and is restrained. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn’t restrained, and can choose to be pushed out of the whirlpool’s space. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. While restrained, a creature is unable to breathe unless it can breathe water, and it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. A creature with a swimming speed has advantage on the saving throw and on the Strength check to escape.</li>
<li><strong>Spellcasting:</strong> The River King casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (save DC 16):<br/>At will: create or destroy water, water breathing<br/>3/day each: freedom of movement, control water<br/>1/day: control weather (as an action)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blade Current:</strong> When a creature within 5 feet of the River King stands up from prone, he can make one Longsword attack against that creature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The River King can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The River King regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack:</strong> The River King makes a Longsword or Flood Blast attack.</li>
<li><strong>Flow:</strong> The River King moves up to his walking speed, or swims up to half his swimming speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Ripple (Costs 2 Actions):</strong> The River King magically ripples like sunlight on the surface of water. Until the start of his next turn, attack rolls against him have disadvantage.</li>
