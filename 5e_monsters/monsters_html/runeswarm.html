<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The runeswarm has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Swarm:</strong> The runeswarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can’t regain hp or gain temporary hp.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The runeswarm can use Runecast. It then makes two cutting runes attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Cutting Runes:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. Hit: 15 (6d4) slashing damage, or 7 (3d4) slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.</li>
<li><strong>Runecast:</strong> The runes swirling within the swarm form into the shape of a random rune, causing one of the following magical effects. Roll a d6 to determine the effect.<br/>1. Algiz. The runeswarm magically calls 2d4 elk or 1 megaloceros. The called creatures arrive on initiative count 20 of the next round and defend the runeswarm. The beasts remain for 1 minute or until the runeswarm dies.<br/>2. Dagaz. The runeswarm emits a burst of blinding light. Each creature within 20-feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.<br/>3. Ehwaz, Raido. A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm gains the benefits of the expeditious retreat and freedom of movement spells for 1 minute.<br/>4. Ingwaz. A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm receives a brief glimpse of the immediate future and has advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.<br/>5. Isaz, Kaunen, Sowilo, Turisaz. Fire, lightning, radiance, or cold winds swirl around the runeswarm. Each creature within 20 feet of the swarm must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold (isaz), fire (kaunen), radiant (sowilo) or lightning (turisaz) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll a d4 to determine the rune: isaz (1), kaunen (2), sowilo (3), turisaz (4).<br/>6. Tewaz. The runeswarm glows with a baleful light. Each creature within 20 feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.</li>
