<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Face:</strong> As a bonus action, the angel of judgment can change its face and demeanor to exhibit aspects of chaos or law, as needed by its assignment. It can have only one face active at a time and can end the effect on its turn as a bonus action. </li>
<li>Face of Chaos. The angel of judgment becomes a harbinger of chaos. It is treated as a fiend by spells and other magical effects that affect fiends and has advantage on attack rolls against celestials and devils. </li>
<li>Face of Law. The angel becomes a harbinger of law and has advantage on attack rolls against demons, fey, and undead.</li>
<li><strong>Divine Awareness:</strong> The angel of judgment knows if it hears a lie.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The angel of judgment has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Penance Gaze:</strong> When a creature that can see the angel of judgment’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the angel, the angel can force it to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw if the angel isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, the creature is stunned until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature is restrained. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the angel until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the angel in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</li>
<li><strong>Weapons of Balance:</strong> The angel of judgment’s weapon attacks are magical. When the angel of judgment hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d8 force damage (included in the attack).</li>
