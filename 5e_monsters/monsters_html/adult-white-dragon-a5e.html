<h3>Special Abilities</h3>

<li><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day):</strong> When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, it sheds some of its scales, which turn to ice. If it has no more uses of this ability, its Armor Class is reduced to 16 until it finishes a long rest.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:dominate beast, fire shield, animal friendship, sleet storm</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>

<li><strong>Tail:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit  reach 15 ft.  one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.</li>
<li><strong>Spit Ice:</strong> The dragon targets a creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure  the target takes 16 (3d10) cold damage  and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success  it takes half damage.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The dragon exhales a 60-foot cone of frost. Each creature in the area makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  it takes 52 (15d6) cold damage  and its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. On a success  it takes half damage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reactions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tail Attack:</strong> When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:</strong> Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</li>
<li><strong>Roar:</strong> Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack:</strong> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.</li>
<li><strong>Raging Storm (1/Day:</strong> For 1 minute, gusts of sleet emanate from the dragon in a 40-foot-radius sphere, spreading around corners. The area is lightly obscured and the ground is difficult terrain The first time a creature moves on its turn while in the area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone (or fall if it is flying).</li>
