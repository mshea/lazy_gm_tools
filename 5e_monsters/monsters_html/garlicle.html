<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plant Camouflage:</strong> The garlicle has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.</li>
<li><strong>Tearful Stench:</strong> Each creature other than an alliumite or garlicle within 5 feet of the garlicle when it takes damage must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of the creature’s next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Tearful Stench of all alliumites and garlicles for 1 minute.</li>
<li><strong>Innate Spellcasting:</strong> The garlicle’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: guidance, shillelagh
3/day: augury, comprehend languages
1/day: divination, entangle</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walking Staff:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +0 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 (1d6 – 2) bludgeoning damage, 2 (1d8 – 2) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.</li>
<li><strong>Cloves of Fate (Recharge 4-6):</strong> The garlicle plucks cloves from its head and throws them at up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Roll a d4 for each creature. The garlicles allies have +1 on the roll while its enemies have a -1 on the roll. Determine the result and consult the following table. <br/>| d4 | Fate |<br/>|----|------|<br/>| 0 | Worst Fortune. Whatever the target is holding slips from its grasp into a random space within 5 feet of the target, and the target falls prone as it trips over a rock, rain-dampened grass, its shoelaces, or similar. |<br/>| 1 | Bad Fortune. The target takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. |<br/>| 2 | Adverse Fortune. The target has disadvantage on its next attack roll. |<br/>| 3 | Favorable Fortune. The target has advantage on its next attack roll. |<br/>| 4 | Good Fortune. The target regains 5 (2d4) hp. |<br/>| 5 | Best Fortune. The target’s next successful hit is critical. |</li>
