Fail: creature is mesmerized 1 min. Mesmerized creature over 5 ft. away from patch must move on its turn toward ooze by most direct route trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks but before moving into damaging terrain such as lava or a pit and whenever it takes damage from a source other than ooze target can re-save. Mesmerized target can also re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.
