<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bound:</strong> The vine golem is psychically bound to its creator and can communicate telepathically with its creator as long as neither is incapacitated. In addition, each knows the distance to and direction of the other. The golem and its creator don’t have to be on the same plane of existence to communicate telepathically, but they do have to be on the same plane to know each other’s distance and direction.</li>
<li><strong>Creator’s Eyes and Ears:</strong> As a bonus action, the creator can see through the vine golem’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of the creator’s next turn, gaining the benefits of the vine golem’s darkvision. During this time, the creator is deaf and blind with regard to its own senses. While using the construct’s senses, the creator can cast a spell through the vine golem, using those senses to target the spell. The range, area, and effect of the spell are calculated as if the spell originated from the vine golem, not the master, though the master must still cast the spell on the master’s turn. Spells that require concentration must be maintained by the master.</li>
<li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The vine golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The vine golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li><strong>Plant Camouflage:</strong> The vine golem has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain that contains ample obscuring plant life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The vine golem makes two thorned vine attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Thorned Vine:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet toward the vine golem.</li>
<li><strong>Thorned Embrace:</strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the vine golem can’t embrace another target.</li>
