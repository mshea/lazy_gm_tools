  "name": "Khopesh of Oblivion"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone."
  "name": "Spiked Gauntlet"
- "desc": "The mask wight emits an ear-piercing wail. Each creature within 30 feet of the mask wight must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) thunder damage and 27 (6d8) psychic damage and is deafened for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t deafened. A creature killed by this wail is erased from the memories of every creature in the planes that ever saw or interacted with it, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated. Only divine beings and creatures that saw the creature die are unaffected by this memory erasure. The slain creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell."
