A creature under the hags curse automatically fails this saving throw. On a failure  the creature is restrained as it begins to turn to ice.

This petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar magic."

The wall lasts for 10 minutes. Each 10-foot section has AC 12  30 hit points  vulnerability to fire damage  and immunity to cold  poison  and psychic damage. Destroying a 10-foot section of wall leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied.
