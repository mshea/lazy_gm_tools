"traits":
- "desc": "The moonkite ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can’t reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled. In addition, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would banish it from its current plane or that would bind it to a particular location or creature. The moonkite can grant this trait to anyone riding it."

If the moonkite scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
  "name": "Wing Buffet"
- "desc": "The moonkite can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except the moonkite can affect only itself and a willing rider, and can’t banish an unwilling creature to another plane."
