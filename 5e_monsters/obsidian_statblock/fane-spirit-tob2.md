  "name": "Incorporeal Movement"
- "desc": "During the day a fane spirit appears much as it did in life and loses its Incorporeal Movement trait, its Touch of Forgetfulness action, and its immunity to being grappled and restrained. It retains all other statistics. While in this form, it has a Strength score of 10. If attacked in this form, it relies on its spells to defend itself, but it reverts to its undead form as soon as it takes any damage.\n\nWhen the sun sets or when it takes any damage, the fane spirit assumes its undead form, and it has all of its listed statistics. Any creature witnessing this transformation must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of its next turn. A fane spirit reverts to its living form in the morning, though creatures witnessing this don’t need to make saving throws."
  "name": "Veil of the Living"
- "desc": "The fane spirit’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\nAt will: chill touch, spare the dying\n3/day each: cure wounds, inflict wounds, shield of faith\n1/day each: augury, hold person, lesser restoration"

The GM decides how this affects the target."
