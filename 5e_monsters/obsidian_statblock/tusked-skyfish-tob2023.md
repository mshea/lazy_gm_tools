- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 14 (4d6) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns, and the skyfish can’t use its Electrified Tentacles on another target."
  "name": "Electrified Tentacles"
- "desc": "The tusked skyfish sprays foul-smelling liquid in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious while poisoned in this way. The unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
