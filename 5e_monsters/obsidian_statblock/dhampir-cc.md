The target must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the dhampir has advantage on Charisma checks against the target. If the dhampir or any of its allies damage the target, the effect ends. If the target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends, the target is immune to this dhampir's Predatory Charm for the next 24 hours. A creature immune to being charmed is immune to this effect. A dhampir can have only one target affected by its Predatory Charm at a time. If it uses its Predatory Charm on another target, the effect on the previous target ends."
