A charmed creature must take Dash action and move toward púca by safest available route on each of its turns trying to get within 5 ft. of the horse to mount it. Each time creature takes damage and at end of each of its turns it can re-save ending effect on itself on success.

After it moves 100' it disappears with captured rider magically racing along a nightmarish landscape. At the next dawn it returns to the space where it disappeared or the nearest unoccupied space the rider lands in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of púca and púca flees. At the end of the ride rider suffers one level of exhaustion."
