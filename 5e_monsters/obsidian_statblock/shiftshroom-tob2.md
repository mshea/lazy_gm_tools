"traits":
- "desc": "The shiftshroom can use its action to alter its appearance into a more frightening fungus, such as a poisonous deathcap mushroom, or back into its true form. Alternatively, it can change back into its true form as a reaction when it takes damage. Its statistics are the same in each form, and it reverts to its true form if it dies. While in its frightening form, the shiftshroom can take only the Dodge, Disengage, and Hide actions. Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of a shiftshroom in its frightening form must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the shiftshroom until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours."
