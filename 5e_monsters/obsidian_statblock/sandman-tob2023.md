Damage from this attack doesn’t wake an unconscious creature, unless the unconscious creature is below half its hp maximum.

- "desc": "The sandman encourages powerful dreams in the minds of up to three unconscious creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, nightmares fill the target’s mind, and the target takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage, wakes from its sleep, and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, pleasant dreams fill the target’s mind, and the target regains 10 (3d6) hp and can choose to remain unconscious or awaken. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
