Only the damage is delayed."

- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage."
  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The chronomatic enhancer spins its time-infused gears, altering time near it. It can’t affect itself with its gears. When activating its time-infused gears, it uses one of the following: \n* Energizing Electricity. The chronomatic enhancer releases mild electricity into up to three creatures the enhancer can see within 30 feet of it. Each target has its speed doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to its AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional bonus action or reaction (target’s choice) until the end of its next turn. \n* Slowing Gas. The chronomatic enhancer releases a slowing gas, affecting up to three creatures it can see within 20 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last until the end of the target’s next turn. \n* Stasis (Recharge 6). The chronomatic enhancer stops time for up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be frozen in time until the end of its next turn. A creature frozen in time is treated as if it is petrified, except it isn’t transformed into an inanimate substance and its weight doesn’t increase."
