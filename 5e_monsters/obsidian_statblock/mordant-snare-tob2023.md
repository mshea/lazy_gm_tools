- "desc": "A mordant snare can spend 8 hours draining a dead Humanoid of its fluids and internal organs, replacing them with the snare’s acid and filaments. The Humanoid’s body then becomes a puppet controlled by the snare. Mordant puppets share a telepathic link with the snare, and each puppet uses the statistics of a zombie.

The mordant snare is indistinguishable from the ground around it while motionless and covered in this way. When a creature enters the mordant snare’s space, the snare can make one Tentacle attack against the creature as a reaction, removing the covering material."
