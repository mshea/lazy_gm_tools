On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and suffers a condition for 1 minute based on the color of the ogre’s horn: blinded (black), charmed (crimson), or frightened (white). On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer the condition. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
