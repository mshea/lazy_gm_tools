- "desc": "When a creature that can see the dimensional shambler starts its turn within 30 feet of the dimensional shambler, the dimensional shambler can force it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the dimensional shambler is not incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If the creature is concentrating on a spell, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the dimensional shambler until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the dimensional shambler in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw."
