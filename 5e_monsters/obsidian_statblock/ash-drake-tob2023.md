Each creature that isn’t an ash drake and that enters the cloud for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn.

A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
