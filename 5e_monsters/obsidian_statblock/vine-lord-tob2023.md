- "desc": "While in a forest, the vine lord regains 10 hp at the start of its turn if it hast at least 1 hp."
  "name": "Green Regeneration"
- "desc": "The vine lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects."
  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "The vine lord and the tendril puppets it has created are connected via a hive mind. The vine lord and its puppets can telepathically communicate with each other, provided the communicating creatures are within 1 mile of each other. In addition, while in a forest, the vine lord can’t be surprised."
  "name": "Root Mind"
- "desc": "A creature infected with a vine lord’s vine seed suffers near-constant pain as the seed takes root and spreads tendrils throughout its body. For the first 24 hours after infection, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, as the pain from the spreading roots distracts it. Then, the seed becomes a disease, devouring the creature from the inside as it grows vines throughout the creature’s body. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can’t regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hp maximum to 0."
  "name": "Vine Seed"

The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vine lord and obeying its spoken commands. The Plants remain for 1 hour, until the vine lord dies, or until the vine lord dismisses them as a bonus action."
