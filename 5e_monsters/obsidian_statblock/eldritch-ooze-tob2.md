- "desc": "When a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher that can see the eldritch ooze starts its turn within 30 feet of the ooze, the ooze can force it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw if the ooze isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If the creature fails, it takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the eldritch ooze until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the ooze in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw."
