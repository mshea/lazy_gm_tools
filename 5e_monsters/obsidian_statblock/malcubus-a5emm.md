On a failure  the target is magically charmed for 1 day or until the malcubus charms another creature. The charmed creature obeys the malcubuss commands.

If the dream lasts for 1 hour  the target gains no benefit from the rest  and the malcubus can use Charm on the creature even if its on a different plane of existence."
