"traits":
- "desc": "When the apau perape takes piercing damage or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from the wound. Each creature within 5 feet of the apau perape must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Mechuiti’s ichor disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 5 (2d4) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0."

  "name": "Fiery Roar (Recharge 6)"
- "desc": "The apau perape magically calls 1d4 apes that are Fiends with the apau perape’s damage resistances and immunities. It has a 50 percent chance of calling one apau perape instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the apau perape and obeying its telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the apau perape dies, or until the apau perape dismisses them as a bonus action."
