  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The harbinger makes one slam attack against a creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is impaled on the harbinger’s spikes. While impaled, the creature is restrained and takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the harbinger’s turns. A creature, including the impaled target, can take its action to free the impaled target by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check. A freed creature falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the harbinger. If the harbinger dies, a creature is no longer restrained and can escape from the harbinger’s spikes by using 10 feet of movement."

The harbinger then regains hp equal to the necrotic damage dealt."
