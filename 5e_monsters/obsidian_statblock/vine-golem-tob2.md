"traits":
- "desc": "The vine golem is psychically bound to its creator and can communicate telepathically with its creator as long as neither is incapacitated. In addition, each knows the distance to and direction of the other. The golem and its creator don’t have to be on the same plane of existence to communicate telepathically, but they do have to be on the same plane to know each other’s distance and direction."
  "name": "Bound"
- "desc": "As a bonus action, the creator can see through the vine golem’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of the creator’s next turn, gaining the benefits of the vine golem’s darkvision. During this time, the creator is deaf and blind with regard to its own senses. While using the construct’s senses, the creator can cast a spell through the vine golem, using those senses to target the spell. The range, area, and effect of the spell are calculated as if the spell originated from the vine golem, not the master, though the master must still cast the spell on the master’s turn. Spells that require concentration must be maintained by the master."
