Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from the shadow beast by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
