- "desc": "If the oasis keeper’s stinger sits in water for at least 1 hour, the water becomes poisoned with its toxin. A creature that drinks the poisoned water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be calmed for 24 hours. A calmed creature feels compelled to stay at the oasis and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice or recognize danger. A calmed creature that drinks the water again before 24 hours have passed has disadvantage on the saving throw. The greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the calming effect early."
