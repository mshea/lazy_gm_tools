They have the following cleric spells prepared:\n Cantrips (at will): light, sacred flame, thaumaturgy\n 1st-level (4 slots): ceremony, detect evil and good, guiding bolt, healing word\n 2nd-level (3 slots): lesser restoration, zone of truth\n 3rd-level (2 slots): dispel magic, spirit guardians"
  "name": "Spellcasting"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit  reach 5 ft.  one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage. On a hit  the priest can expend a spell slot to deal 7 (2d6) radiant damage  plus an extra 3 (1d6) radiant damage for each level of the spell slot expended above 1st."
  "name": "Mace"
- "desc": "One creature the priest can see within 60 feet makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage on a failure. This spell ignores cover."
  "name": "Sacred Flame (Cantrip; V, S)"
- "desc": "Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit  range 120 ft.  one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) radiant damage  and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of the priests next turn has advantage."
  "name": "Guiding Bolt (1st-Level; V, S)"
- "desc": "The priest scours the magic from one creature  object  or magical effect within 120 feet that they can see. A spell ends if it was cast with a 3rd-level or lower spell slot. For spells using a 4th-level or higher spell slot  the priest makes a Wisdom ability check (DC 10 + the spells level) for each one  ending the effect on a success."
  "name": "Dispel Magic (3rd-Level; V, S)"
- "desc": "Spectral forms surround the priest in a 10-foot radius for 10 minutes. The priest can choose creatures they can see to be unaffected by the spell. Other creatures treat the area as difficult terrain  and when a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there  it makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw  taking 10 (3d6) radiant or necrotic damage (priests choice) on a failure or half damage on a success."
  "name": "Spirit Guardians (3rd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The priest or a living creature within 60 feet regains 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points. The priest can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn."
  "name": "Healing Word (1st-Level; V)"
- "desc": "In a small community lucky enough to have one, a priest is the primary spiritual leader, healer, and defender against supernatural evil. In a city, a priest might lead prayers at a temple, sometimes under the guidance of a high priest."
  "name": "Priests are ordained followers of a deity whose faith grants them spellcasting abilities"
