When a creature proficient with smith’s tools scores a critical hit vs. thursir armorer armorer’s armor breaks reducing armorer’s AC by 5 until armorer repairs armor. If armorer is critically hit by any creature while its armor is broken armor shatters and is destroyed reducing armorer’s AC to 12."
