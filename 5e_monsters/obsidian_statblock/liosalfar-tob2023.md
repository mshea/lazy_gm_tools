  "name": "Inscrutable"
- "desc": "The liosalfar can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Each creature within 60 feet of the liosalfar and that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the display ends. The liosalfar must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue the display. It can stop the display at any time, and the display ends if the liosalfar is incapacitated. While charmed by the liosalfar’s display, a creature is also incapacitated, and its speed is reduced to 0, as it is transfixed by the display. The effect ends for a charmed creature if it takes any damage or if someone uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor."
