"traits":
- "desc": "If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead."
  "name": "Legendary Resistance (3/Day)"
- "desc": "As a bonus action, the vampire can rise or descend vertically up to 20 feet and can remain suspended there. This trait works like the levitate spell, except there is no duration, and the vampire doesn’t need to concentrate to continue levitating each round."
  "name": "Levitate"
- "desc": "The vampire regains 20 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn."
  "name": "Regeneration"
- "desc": "The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check."
  "name": "Spider Climb"
- "desc": "The vampire has the following flaws:\n* Forbiddance. The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\n* Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.\n* Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.\n* Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks."

"actions":

  "name": "Unarmed Strike"
- "desc": "The vampire chooses one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 minute. While incapacitated, its speed is reduced to 0 and its mind is overwhelmed with a flood of its own insecurities, shortcomings and inability to accomplish its goals. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The target can also repeat the saving throw if another creature uses an action to shake the target out of its stupor."
  "name": "Imprison Mind"
- "desc": "The vampire chooses one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage and suffer memory loss, and the vampire regains hp equal to the psychic damage dealt. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control. The target’s memory loss can manifest in a variety of ways. Roll a d4 and consult the table below. If the target is already affected by one of these options, roll again, unless otherwise noted. The memory loss lasts until it is cured by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.\n| d4 | Memory Loss |\n|----|-------------|\n| 1 | The target forgets how to use a particular skill or tool. It has disadvantage on one random skill or tool proficiency. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, randomly choose an additional skill or tool proficiency to also be affected. |\n| 2 | The target forgets one of its current allies and now views the ally as hostile. If the target is already affected by this memory loss, choose an additional ally. |\n| 3 | The target forgets key aspects of fighting and has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn. |\n| 4 | The target forgets how to defend itself properly, and the first attack roll against it each turn has advantage. |"

  "name": "Knowledge Keepers (1/Day)"
