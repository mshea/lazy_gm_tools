- "desc": "Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the darakhul’s Stench for 24 hours."

  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the victim has darakhul fever, this reduction can’t be removed until the victim recovers from the disease. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises as a ghast 1d4 hours later under the darakhul captain’s control, unless the humanoid is restored to life"
  "name": "Imperial Conscription (Recharge 6)"

The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the captain. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the captain is incapacitated."
