  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "When a creature casts the knock spell on the chained angel’s chains, the chains release a blast of unholy flame. The spellcaster must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) fire damage and 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the spellcaster survives, the chained angel must immediately make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the angel’s chains fall away. It is restored to its senses and the form it had before it was chained, typically a deva. On a failure, the chained angel remains chained for 7 days, and during that time, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel’s chains fail."

"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature the chained angel can see within 60 feet of it casts a spell that appears on the cleric or paladin spell list, the chained angel can counter the spell with a successful ability check. This works like the counterspell spell with a +5 spellcasting ability check, except the chained angel must make the ability check no matter the level of the spell."
