While laughing, the target falls prone, is incapacitated, and unable to move. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the shurale’s Tickle for the next 24 hours. If the target fails the saving throw three times, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hp and begin dying. On a success, the laughter ends on the target, as normal."
