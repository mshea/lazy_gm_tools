- "desc": "When a creature that can see the drake starts its turn within 60 feet of the drake, the drake can force it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw if the drake isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated until the start of its next turn.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the drake until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the drake in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."

  "name": "Stellar Breath (Recharge 5-6)"
