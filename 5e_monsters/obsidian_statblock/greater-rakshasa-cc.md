The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic."
  "name": "Claw"
- "desc": "The greater rakshasa chooses a point it can see within 60 feet, conjuring a terrifying manifestation of its enemies' worst fears in a 30-foot-radius around the point. Each non-rakshasa in the area must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 66 (12d10) psychic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
