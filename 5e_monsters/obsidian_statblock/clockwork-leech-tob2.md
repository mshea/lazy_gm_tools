- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the clockwork leech attaches to the target. While attached, the leech doesn’t attack. Instead, at the start of each of the clockwork leech’s turns, the target loses 5 (1d6 + 2) hp due to blood loss, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the leech’s next turn. The clockwork leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hp of blood from its target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the leech by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check."
