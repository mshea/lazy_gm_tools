- "desc": "The bulette leaps up to half its Speed horizontally and half its Speed vertically without provoking opportunity attacks  and can land in a space containing one or more creatures. Each creature in its space when it lands makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw  taking 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failure. On a success  the creature takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet to a space of its choice. If that space is occupied  the creature is knocked prone."
  "name": "Leap (Recharge 5-6)"
- "desc": "The bulette burrows under the ground without provoking opportunity attacks  moves up to its burrow speed  and then resurfaces in an unoccupied space. If it is within 5 feet of a creature  it then makes a bite attack."

Until this grapple ends, the grappled creature is restrained, and the only attack the bulette can make is a bite against the grappled creature."
  "name": "Jaw Clamp (1/Day)"
