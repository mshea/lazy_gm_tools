- "desc": "The ghillie dubh has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain."
  "name": "Forest Camouflage"
- "desc": "If the ghillie dubh has spent at least 24 hours in a forest, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in that forest. In addition, it can spend 10 minutes focusing its attention on the forest and an invisible, sapling-shaped sensor anywhere in its forest within 1 mile of it. It can see and hear everything within 60 feet of this sensor, but it is deaf and blind with regard to its own senses while doing so. The sensor lasts for 1 minute or until the ghillie dubh dismisses it (no action required)."
  "name": "One with the Trees"
- "desc": "The ghillie dubh can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language."
  "name": "Speak with Beasts and Plants"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage."
  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The ghillie dubh can alter nearby creatures’ knowledge of the forest, choosing one of the following. An effect lasts for 24 hours, until the creature leaves the ghillie dubh’s forest, or until the ghillie dubh dismisses it as a bonus action. \n* Remove Knowledge. Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become hopelessly lost in the ghillie dubh’s forest. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks and takes 50 percent more time on overland travel, even delaying clearheaded companions. \n* Share Knowledge. Each creature within 30 feet of the ghillie dubh has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks. The creature can move at a fast pace through forest terrain, and difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn’t cost it extra movement."
  "name": "Forest Knowledge (Recharge 6)"
