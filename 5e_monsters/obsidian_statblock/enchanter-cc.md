The charmed target's speed is reduced to 0, it is incapacitated, and it must spend each round looking at the enchanter. While looking at the enchanter, the charmed target is considered blinded to other creatures not between it and the enchanter. The charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the charmed target takes damage from one of the enchanter's allies, it has advantage on the next saving throw. The effect also ends if the creature can no longer see or hear the enchanter. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the enchanter's Captivating Gaze for the next 24 hours."
