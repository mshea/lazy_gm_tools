- "desc": "A cloud of green mist with a diameter of 1 mile and height of 60 feet is centered on the spirit.

The mist has no effect on undead or constructs."
  "name": "Decrepit Mist"

  "name": "Hunter of the Living"

  "name": "Censer"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (4d6) necrotic damage, and the target’s Strength score is reduced by 1d6. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest."
  "name": "Enfeebling Touch"
- "desc": "The plague spirit dances and twirls its censer. Each creature within 20 feet of the plague spirit that can see it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
