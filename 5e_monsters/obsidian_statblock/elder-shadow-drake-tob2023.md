- "desc": "The elder shadow drake spits a ball of black liquid on a point the dragon can see within 60 feet of it. The ball bursts into a 20-foot-radius sphere of black mist centered on that point for 1 minute.

The mist spreads around corners, and its area is magical darkness. No natural light can illuminate the mist. If any of the mist overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 1st level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled."
