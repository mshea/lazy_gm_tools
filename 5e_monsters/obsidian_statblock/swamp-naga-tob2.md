"traits":
- "desc": "A cloud of biting and stinging insects surrounds the swamp naga. A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the naga must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the insect cloud for 1 minute. As a bonus action, the naga can disperse the cloud for 1 minute."
