A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the foxin's Illusory Calm for the next 24 hours. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if it suffers any harm while charmed."
