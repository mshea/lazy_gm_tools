  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "One creature the sarcophagus slime can see within 30 feet of it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target’s hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises 24 hours later as a sarcophagus slime, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed."
  "name": "Corrupting Gaze"
- "desc": "Each creature of the sarcophagus slime’s choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours."
