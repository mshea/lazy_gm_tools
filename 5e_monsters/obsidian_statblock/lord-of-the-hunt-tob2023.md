If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the Lord’s Call to the Hunt for the next 24 hours. The Lord can have only one target charmed at a time. If he charms another, the effect on the previous target ends."
