- "desc": "One creature the horseman can see and that the horseman hit with a Horseman’s Bolt or Longsword attack within the last minute must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or age 16 (3d10) years. A creature that ages this way has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the aging is reversed. A creature that ages beyond its lifespan dies immediately. The aging lasts until the creature finishes a long rest, or until it is reversed by a greater restoration spell or similar magic. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the horseman’s Temporal Strike for 24 hours."
