On a failed save, the creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.\n\nA creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the de ogen until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the de ogen in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving throw.\n\nCreatures immune to being frightened are immune to the de ogen’s Transfixing Gaze."
