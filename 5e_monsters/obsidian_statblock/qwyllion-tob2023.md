- "desc": "A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the qwyllion must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature that fails this saving throw is also incapacitated while poisoned in this way. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the qwyllion’s Nauseating Stench for the next 24 hours."

The qwyllion can have no more than ten specters under its control at one time."
  "name": "Deadly Gaze"
- "desc": "One Humanoid or Beast the qwyllion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the qwyllion’s verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the qwyllion’s Charm for the next 24 hours."
