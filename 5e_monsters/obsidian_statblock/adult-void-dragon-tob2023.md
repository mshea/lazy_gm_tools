- "desc": "Each creature of the dragon’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or suffer short-term madness for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Aura of Madness for the next 24 hours."
  "name": "Aura of Madness"
- "desc": "The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons."
  "name": "Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)"
- "desc": "The dragon exhales localized gravity in a 60-foot cube, originating from the dragon. When a creature ends a fall in the cube, it takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d10. A creature that enters the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is restrained. On a success, the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains in the cube. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cube lasts until the dragon’s breath weapon recharges."
  "name": "Gravitic Breath"
- "desc": "The dragon exhales star fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) fire damage and 31 (9d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
  "name": "Stellar Breath"
"reactions":
- "desc": "The dragon adds 5 to its AC against one attack that would hit it, as it twists reality to open a small rift in space to protect itself. To do so, the dragon must be able to see the attacker. If the attack misses by 5 or more, the dragon can choose to open a second, connected rift next to another creature it can see within 30 feet of it to direct the attack at that creature instead, using the original attack roll result against the new target’s AC."
