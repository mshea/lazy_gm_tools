- "desc": "The lich hums a discordant melody, paints a crumbling symbol of death in the air, performs a reality-bending pirouette, or emulates some other expression of corrupted or twisted art and targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. This action’s effects change, depending on if the target is undead. \n* Non-Undead. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. \n* Undead. The target regains 18 (4d8) hit points. Healing that exceeds the target’s hp maximum becomes temporary hit points."
  "name": "Corrupted Art"
- "desc": "The lich targets one humanoid or beast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lich for 1 minute. The charmed target, the lich’s “muse,” has a speed of 0 and is incapacitated as it watches or listens to the lich’s artistic expression. The muse can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the lich’s Call Muse for the next 24 hours. If the muse suffers harm from the lich, it is no longer charmed.\n\nThe lich can have only one muse at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous muse ends. If the lich is within 30 feet of its muse and can see its muse, the lich has advantage on its first Artistic Flourish attack each round against a creature that isn’t its muse."
