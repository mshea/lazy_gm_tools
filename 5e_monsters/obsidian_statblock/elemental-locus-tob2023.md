  "name": "Elemental Nature"
- "desc": "If the elemental locus dies, it returns to life in 1d12 months, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears in a space of the locus’s choice within its bound land. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning."
  "name": "Immortal"
- "desc": "The elemental locus is bound to an area of land or ocean no larger than 100 square miles. If it leaves this region, it loses its Spawn Elemental action. If it remains outside the region, it automatically teleports back to the center of this area after 24 hours, regardless of distance."
  "name": "Land Bound"

  "name": "Siege Monster"

  "name": "Multiattack"

  "name": "Slam"
- "desc": "The elemental locus magically creates up to 2d6 mephits or 1 Elemental with a challenge rating of 5 or lower. The Elementals arrive at the start of the locus’s next turn, acting as allies of the locus and obeying its spoken commands. The locus can create only Elementals that share an element with a terrain feature comprising at least 100,000 square feet of the locus’s bound land. For example, a desert-bound locus can’t create a water-based Elemental, unless its bound desert contains an oasis or other source of water around the size of a small pond."
