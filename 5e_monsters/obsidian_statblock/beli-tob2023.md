Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion from the arrow’s icy chill. On a success, the target can’t suffer further levels of exhaustion from any beli’s Icy Shortbow for 24 hours. If a creature would suffer a sixth level of exhaustion from this attack, it is reduced to 0 hp instead and must make death saving throws as normal.
