- "desc": "A dome of magic covers the nautiloid just large enough to contain its shell. The nautiloid can control the ambient pressure temperature water levels and breathable air levels (for air-breathing passengers) inside allowing creatures and objects within it to exist comfortably in spite of conditions outside. Creatures and objects within the shell have total cover vs. attacks and other effects outside the nautiloid. Creatures inside the shell can exit whenever they want but nothing can pass into the shell’s dome unless the nautiloid allows it. Area inside dome is a magnificent palace carved into nautiloid’s shell complete with open ‘air’ balconies used as entrances/exits and numerous covered chambers that can comfortably hold up to 50 passengers. Palace is 60' long 30' wide and 80' tall. When it dies any creatures inside dome are expelled into unoccupied spaces near the closest exit."

Each creature within 15 ft. of the space the nautiloid left and each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Con save. On a failure a creature takes 45 (10d8) force and is pushed up to 20' away from the nautiloid and knocked prone. On a success a creature takes half the damage but isn’t pushed or knocked prone."
