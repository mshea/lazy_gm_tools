The helashruu can have only one creature trapped at a time. A fragmented caricature of the trapped creature appears on the helashruu’s surface while a creature is trapped inside it.\n\nIf the helashruu takes 30 or more bludgeoning or thunder damage on a single turn, the helashruu must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or release the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the helashruu.
