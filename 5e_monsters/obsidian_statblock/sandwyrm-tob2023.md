The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. When the sandwyrm moves, a restrained creature moves with it. The sandwyrm can have only one creature restrained at a time. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check."
