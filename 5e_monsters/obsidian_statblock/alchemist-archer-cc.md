The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) thunder damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\nEntangling. The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) acid damage and is restrained by sticky, alchemical goo. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 16 Strength check, bursting through the goo on a success. The goo can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; immunity to piercing, slashing, poison, and psychic damage).\nExplosive.
