  "name": "Magic Resistance"
- "desc": "As a bonus action, the baliri brays praise to the demon lord that saved it from its previous life, channeling the demon lord’s might. The baliri chooses up to three demons within 30 feet of it. Each target has advantage on the first ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of the baliri’s next turn. In addition, the targets are unaffected by the baliri’s Blood Bray."
  "name": "Praising Brays"
"actions":
- "desc": "The baliri demon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its pincers."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage."
  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage. If the baliri demon scores a critical hit against a creature, roll a d6. On a 1-3, it severs the target’s arm, and on a 4-6 it severs the target’s leg. A creature missing an arm can’t wield weapons that require two hands, and if a creature is missing a leg, its speed is halved. Creatures without limbs are unaffected."
  "name": "Pincers"
- "desc": "The baliri demon unleashes an otherworldly braying that causes the internal organs of nearby creatures to twist and rupture. Each creature within 20 feet of the baliri that can hear it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn as it doubles over in agony. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. The bray doesn’t affect creatures without internal organs, such as constructs, elementals, and oozes."
  "name": "Blood Bray (Recharge 6)"
