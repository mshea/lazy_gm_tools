- "desc": "When the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it does, its eyes flash red as it goes into a fit of rage.

As an action, the dragon can psionically observe a creature, object, or location it is familiar with within 100 miles. While observing a subject in this way, the dragon can see, hear, and communicate telepathically, but it is blind and deaf in regard to its physical senses and does not require food or water. The dragon can psionically observe a subject indefinitely and can end this effect and return to its own senses as an action."

  "name": "Psionic Wave"

Each creature in that area makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw  taking 71 (13d10) thunder damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Creatures that fail this saving throw by 10 or more are also psionically confused until the end of their next turn."
