"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The treacle attaches to the target. While attached, the treacle can’t attack, and at the start of each of the treacle’s turns, the target loses 5 (2d4) hp due to blood loss. Each time the target loses hp in this way, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the treacle is attached and harming it, otherwise it is unaware the hp loss is from the treacle. A creature that loses hp in this way while below half its hp maximum automatically succeeds on this check."
  "name": "Blood Drain"
"reactions":
- "desc": "When a creature the treacle can see moves within 120 feet of it, the treacle squishes, stretches, and molds its body into the shape of a Tiny Beast or object the creature finds least threatening, such as an injured rabbit or a long-lost toy. The treacle’s body takes on most of the coloration of the desired shape, but some part of it is always white, pale, or pearlescent. Regardless of the shape, the treacle’s flesh doesn’t change and is soft and plush to the touch. The treacle can maintain this shape for up to 8 hours or until another creature it can see moves within 120 feet of it."
  "name": "Mimic Innocence"
