  "name": "Deadly Breath (Recharge 4-6)"
- "desc": "The korrigan sings a magical melody and dances. Each humanoid within 60 feet of the korrigan that can hear the revels must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the revels end. For every korrigan that joins in the revels, the save DC increases by 1 (maximum DC 19). \n\nEach korrigan participating in the revels must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing and must use its move action to move at least 5 feet to continue dancing. It can keep singing and dancing for up to 1 minute as long as it maintains concentration. The song ends if all of the korrigan lose concentration or stop singing and dancing. \n\nA charmed target is incapacitated and begins to dance and caper for the duration of the revels. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Enchanting Revels of the same band of korrigan for the next 24 hours."
