If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the khodumodumo, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the khodumodumo, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the khodumodumo’s turns.\n\nIf the khodumodumo takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the khodumodumo must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the khodumodumo. If the khodumodumo dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."

In addition, at the start of each of the target’s turns, the target takes 8 (1d4 + 6) piercing damage."
