- "desc": "The bagiennik sprays acid on one creature it can see within 30 feet of it, creating a puddle of oil beneath the creature. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (4d8) acid damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t knocked prone. The slippery oil covers the ground in a 5-foot square centered on the point where the target was standing for 1 minute. A creature that enters the oily area or ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone."

- "desc": "The bagiennik applies healing oil to a creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 7 (2d6) hp and is freed from any disease or poison. The target must then succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its speed is halved and it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute."
