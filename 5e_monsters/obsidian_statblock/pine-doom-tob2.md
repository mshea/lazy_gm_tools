- "desc": "A creature that touches the pine doom is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained. In addition, when a creature hits the pine doom with a bludgeoning or piercing weapon while within 5 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the weapon becomes stuck to the tree. A stuck weapon canâ€™t be used. A creature can take its action to remove one stuck weapon from the pine doom by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. Splashing the pine doom with a gallon of alcohol frees all creatures and objects stuck to it and suppresses this trait for 1 minute."
