  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (8d6 + 8) slashing damage."
  "name": "Greatsword"
- "desc": "Ranged Spell Attack:+9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn as pain courses through its body."
  "name": "Word of Pain"
- "desc": "The titan speaks a phrase that temporarily reshapes reality around it, warping the terrain, displacing creatures, and disrupting magic. Each creature within 30 feet of the titan must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled or pushed up to 25 feet toward or away from the titan (the titan’s choice) and knocked prone. Instead of pushing or pulling a creature that failed the saving throw, the titan can end one magical effect of its choice of 4th level or lower on that creature. The area then becomes difficult terrain until the start of the titan’s next turn. Moving through this difficult terrain doesn’t cost the titan extra movement."
  "name": "Reality-Altering Words"
- "desc": "The titan speaks a brief, echoing word of power at up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) force damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t stunned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
  "name": "Stunning Word (Recharge 5–6)"
