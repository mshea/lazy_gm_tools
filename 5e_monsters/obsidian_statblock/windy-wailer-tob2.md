- "desc": "When a creature that can see the windy wailer starts its turn within 30 feet of the wailer, the wailer can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the wailer isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 as it is mesmerized by the windy wailer.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the windy wailer until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the windy wailer in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."

  "name": "Wind Blast"
- "desc": "The windy wailer unleashes freezing wind filled with fearful wailing in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) cold damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nA creature reduced to 0 hp by the windy wailer’s Frightful Gale and later revived is permanently marked by a shock of white hair somewhere on its body."
