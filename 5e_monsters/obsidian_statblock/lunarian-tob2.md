  "name": "Descendant of The Moon"
- "desc": "A lunarian can never be in the presence of natural light. It takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage at the beginning of its turn if it is exposed to direct moonlight or sunlight. If this damage reduces the lunarian to 0 hp, it dies and turns to moondust."
  "name": "Major Surface Curse"
- "desc": "The lunarian’s weapon attacks are magical. When the lunarian hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4 (1d8) radiant damage (included in the attack). A creature that takes radiant damage from a lunarian’s weapon sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius for 1 hour."
  "name": "Moon-Touched Weapons"
- "desc": "As a bonus action, the lunarian summons a beam of pale light, shot through with undulating waves of shadow, centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it. The beam is a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder and lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on each of its turns, the lunarian can move the beam up to 20 feet in any direction. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the beam must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 11 (2d10) necrotic damage and is cursed with the minor surface curse. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t cursed."
