- "desc": "A creature the qiqirn can hear can use its action to say “qiqirn” and make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. If it does so, the qiqirn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the creature’s Charisma (Intimidation) check or be frightened of that creature until the end of its next turn.

- "desc": "The qiqirn releases a spirt-infused yip at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the qiqirn, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
