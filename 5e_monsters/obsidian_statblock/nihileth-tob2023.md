- "desc": "The nihileth has resistance to acid, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, it has immunity to the prone condition, and it has immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

- "desc": "If a creature communicates telepathically with the nihileth, or deals psychic damage to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become infected with the nihilethic rot disease."
  "name": "Infecting Telepathy"
- "desc": "This disease takes 1 minute to manifest in an infected creature, during which time the disease can be removed with the lesser restoration spell. After 1 minute, the creature’s flesh becomes slimy and translucent, and the disease can be cured only by the heal spell or similar magic. Until this disease is cured, the creature can’t regain hp unless it is submerged in water, and it can breathe air and water. The creature must be submerged in water at least once every 2 hours to avoid suffocating, and if it is outside a body of water, it takes 7 (2d6) acid damage every 10 minutes, unless moisture is applied to its skin before 10 minutes have passed. If a Humanoid dies while infected with this disease, it rises 1 minute later as a nihilethic zombie under the nihileth’s control. If a Large giant or monstrosity dies while infected with this disease, it rises 1 minute later as a nihilethic dominator under the nihileth’s control."

In addition, a creature infected with nihilethic rot takes 7 (2d6) cold damage when it starts its turn within this aura."
