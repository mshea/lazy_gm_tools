- "desc": "The song angel blows on its ram's horn, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 35 (10d6) thunder damage instead."

These spirits follow the angel's commands."

Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the angel's choice).\n\nIn the new form, the angel retains its game statistics and the ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks."
