- "desc": "The lindwurm can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement."

  "name": "Sure-Footed Skater"
"actions":
- "desc": "The lindwurm makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with one Constrict attack."
  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion and doesn’t regain expended Hit Dice from the rest. On a success, the creature’s exhaustion level decreases by one, and it regains expended Hit Dice as normal from the rest. If a successful saving throw reduces the diseased creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease, ending it."
