- "desc": "When she drops to 0 hp outside her resting place, the vampire priestess transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that she isn't in running water. If she can't transform, she is destroyed. While she has 0 hp in mist form, she can't revert to her priestess form, and she must reach her resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. \n\nWhile in mist form she can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. She is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, she can do so without squeezing, and she can't pass through water. She has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and she is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage she takes from sunlight. \n\nOnce in her resting place, she reverts to her priestess form. She is then paralyzed until she regains at least 1 hp. After spending 1 hour in her resting place with 0 hp, she regains 1 hp. s"
