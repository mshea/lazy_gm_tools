A charmed creature that moves more than 100 feet away from the august rooster ceases to be charmed. If the august rooster requests that a charmed creature do more than tend to the creature’s own needs, pay devotion to the august rooster, or bring the rooster food and gifts, the charmed creature can make a new saving throw with advantage.
