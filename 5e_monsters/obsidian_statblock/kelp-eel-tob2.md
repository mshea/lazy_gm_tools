"traits":
- "desc": "When the kelp eel is reduced to 0 hp, it disperses into its component kelp in a 30-foot cube. The area is difficult terrain for 1 hour. At the end of that hour, the kelp eel reforms, regaining half its hp and becoming active again. If more than half the kelp that comprises the dispersed kelp eel is removed from the water and dried, it can’t reform and the creature is destroyed."

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the kelp eel can’t use the same kelp tendril on another target. In addition, at the start of the target’s next turn, it begins to suffocate as the eel’s grip crushes the breath out of it."
