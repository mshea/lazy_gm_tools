  "name": "Necrotic Weapons"
- "desc": "The flutterflesh regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If the flutterflesh takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the flutterflesh’s next turn. The flutterflesh dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn’t regenerate."

A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."

Each creature within 20 feet of the flutterflesh must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature below half its hp maximum has disadvantage on this saving throw."
