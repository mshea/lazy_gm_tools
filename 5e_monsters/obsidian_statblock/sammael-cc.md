  "name": "Angelic Weapons"
- "desc": "The sammael angel can use its bonus action to shift its purpose between Destructor, Executioner, and Punisher. \n* Destructor. The sammael's purpose is to destroy unholy monuments and statues. Its weapon attacks deal double damage to objects and structures. \n* Executioner. The sammael's purpose is to slay a specific creature. The angel has advantage on attack rolls against a specific creature, chosen by its deity. As long as the angel and the victim are on the same plane of existence, the angel knows the precise location of the creature. \n* Punisher. The sammael's purpose is to punish, but not kill, creatures, inflicting long-term suffering on those of its deity's choosing. A creature reduced to 0 hp by the angel loses 3 (1d6) Charisma as its body is horribly scarred by the deity's retribution. The scars last until the creature is cured by the greater restoration spell or similar magic."
