  "name": "Lightning Bolt (3rd-Level; V, S, M)"
- "desc": "The mage teleports to a location within 500 feet. They can bring along one willing Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. If a creature would teleport to an occupied space  it takes 14 (4d6) force damage  and the spell fails."

- "desc": "A 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous  sickly green fog appears centered on a point within 120 feet. It lasts for 10 minutes. It spreads around corners  heavily obscures the area  and can be dispersed by a strong wind  ending the spell early. Until the spell ends  when a creature starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on a turn  it makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw  taking 22 (5d8) poison damage on a failure or half damage on a success. The fog moves away from the mage 10 feet at the start of each of its turns  sinking to the level of the ground in that space."

- "desc": "When a creature the mage can see within 60 feet casts a spell, the mage attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a 2nd-level spell or lower, the spell fails. If the creature is casting a 3rd-level or higher spell, the mage makes an Intelligence check against a DC of 10 + the spells level. On a success, the spell fails, and the spellcasting creature can use its reaction to try to cast a second spell with the same casting time so long as it uses a spell slot level equal to or less than half the original spell slot. If the mage casts counterspell with a higher spell slot, the interrupted spell fails if its level is less than that of counterspell."
