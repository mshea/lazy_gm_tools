A spellcaster within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 spellcasting ability check to cast a spell with a verbal component. In addition, a creature that is concentrating on a spell and that starts its turn within 30 feet of the mosquito must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on the spell."
