- "desc": "Creatures that make a pact or agree to terms while the drake witnesses the agreement are bound by the drake's magic. They have disadvantage on saving throws against scrying by the drake (simply making a successful save against the drake's scrying usually is enough to arouse its suspicion), and they become potential targets for the drake's Punish Transgressor action."

- "desc": "The drake knows if it hears a lie."
  "name": "Sense Falsehood"

  "name": "Bite"
- "desc": "The pact drake breathes a calming haze in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, a creature also can't attack up to five creatures of the pact drake's choice. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success."
  "name": "Enforced Diplomacy (Recharge 5-6)"
- "desc": "The drake targets a single creature within 60 feet that broke the terms of a pact witnessed by the drake. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1d6 minutes. The conditions can be ended early only with a dispel magic (DC 15) spell or similar magic. When these conditions end, the affected creature has disadvantage on saving throws until it finishes a long rest."
