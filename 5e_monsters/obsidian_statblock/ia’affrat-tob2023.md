- "desc": "Ia’Affrat’s individual Fiends are connected via a hive mind. He can telepathically communicate with any of his individual Fiends within 50 miles of him, and he can’t be surprised. If he is reduced to half his hp or lower, his Intelligence score is reduced to 10, he immediately changes into his shapeless form, and he can’t take on a Humanoid form again until he regains hp to be above half his hp or he finishes a long rest."

  "name": "Magic Resistance"

The area is lightly obscured to all except Ia’Affrat, and each non-devil creature that starts its turn in the smoke must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its turn. At the start of each of his turns, Ia’Affrat chooses whether this shroud is active."
  "name": "Smoke Shroud"

- "desc": "Ia’Affrat makes three Bite or Burning Claw attacks, or he makes four Flaming Insect Bolt attacks."

  "name": "Flaming Insect Bolt"
- "desc": "Ia’Affrat crawls into the body of a Humanoid, or a Humanoid corpse that has been dead no more than 7 days, that he can see within 5 feet of him. If the target is unwilling, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or the target loses control of its body, and Ia’Affrat takes control of the body. Ia’Affrat controls the body but doesn’t deprive the target of awareness. Ia’Affrat can’t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and he retains his alignment, his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, his Hurl Flame action and Teleport and Consume Host legendary actions, and his condition immunities. He otherwise uses the target’s statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. If the target was a Humanoid corpse, he uses the statistics it had before it died."
