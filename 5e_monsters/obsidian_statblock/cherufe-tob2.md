Each creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse as if the structure was in the area of an earthquake spell. The cherufe can have only one fissure open at a time. If it opens another, the previous fissure closes, shunting all creatures inside it to the surface."
