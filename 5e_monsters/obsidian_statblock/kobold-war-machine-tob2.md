When it has more than one operator, it has additional traits as long as the additional operators spend their entire turns operating the war machine.\n\nIf a creature scores a critical hit against the kobold war machine, the creature can target one of the operators with the attack instead. Otherwise, the operators can’t be targeted and are immune to damage while operating the kobold war machine."
