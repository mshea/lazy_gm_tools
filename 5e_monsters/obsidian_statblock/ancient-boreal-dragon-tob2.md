- "desc": "As a bonus action, the boreal dragon wreathes its body in searing blue and white embers. The embers last for 1 minute or until the dragon uses its breath weapon. A creature that enters or starts its turn in a space within 30 feet of the dragon must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers one level of exhaustion as the water is sapped from its body by the unrelenting heat."
