If the target is within a fey court or castle, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become invisible, silent, and paralyzed for 1 minute, while an illusory version of the target under the footman’s control remains visible and audible. The illusion shouts to the target’s allies for a retreat or similar action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself and destroying the illusory double on a success."
