  "name": "Grappler"
- "desc": "The voidpool has a portal to the Void at its core. A creature that starts its turn grappled by the voidpool must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a success, the creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage but isn’t pulled toward the portal. On a failure, the creature takes no damage but is pulled closer to the portal. A creature that fails three saving throws before escaping the grapple enters the portal and is transported to the Void. This transportation works like the banishing an unwilling creature aspect of the plane shift spell."

  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the voidpool doesn’t have two other creatures grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and it risks being pulled into the Void (see the Planar Portal trait)."
