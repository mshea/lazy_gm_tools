  "name": "Time-Warping Staff"
- "desc": "The drifter chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of its future self. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and is pulled forward in time. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t pulled forward in time. A target pulled forward in time disappears, along with the drifter’s future self, as the future self pulls the target with it. At the end of the drifter’s next turn, the target and the drifter’s future self reappear in the spaces they previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied spaces. When the target reappears, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn as it recovers from the disorienting experience."
  "name": "Drift Forward (Recharge 5–6)"
"bonus_actions":
- "desc": "The eonic drifter calls to a future version of itself, which appears in an unoccupied space the drifter can see within 30 feet of it. The drifter’s future self acts on the drifter’s turn, and each turn it makes one Time-Warping Staff attack against a creature of the drifter’s choice or uses the Help action to aid the drifter. The future self can be attacked and destroyed (AC 13; hp 30; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage; immunity to poison and psychic damage), otherwise it remains until the drifter dismisses it as a bonus action or the drifter finishes a long rest. If the drifter’s future self is destroyed, the drifter must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn."
  "name": "Call to the Future (1/Day)"
