- "desc": "The nauthveli is surrounded by a supernatural aura of dread. Each creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the nauthveli must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature immersed in water has disadvantage on this saving throw. A frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If the nauthveli dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone."

On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone."
