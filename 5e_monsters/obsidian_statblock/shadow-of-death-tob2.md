While frightened in this way, the creature is also paralyzed as it sees visions of its death. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this shadow of death’s Vision of Ending for the next 24 hours."
