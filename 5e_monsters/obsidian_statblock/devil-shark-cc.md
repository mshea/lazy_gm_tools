While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the devil shark, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the devil shark's turns. A devil shark can have two Large, four Medium, or six Small creatures swallowed at a time. \n\nIf the devil shark takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the devil shark must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of the devil shark. If the devil shark dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone."
