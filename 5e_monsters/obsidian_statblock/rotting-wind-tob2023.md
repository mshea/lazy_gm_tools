- "desc": "The rotting wind radiates an aura of poison and decay that slowly pollutes the area within 30 feet of it. Each hour the rotting wind stays in a place, nonmagical plants in the aura begin to wither, and water in the aura becomes poisoned. Nonmagical plants in the aura for 24 hours die. A creature that drinks water poisoned by the aura must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the tomb rot disease (see the Tomb Rot trait). Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease."
  "name": "Poisonous Aura"
- "desc": "A creature infested with this disease manifests symptoms 1d4 days after infection, which include muscle weakness and rotten-smelling breath as its body rots from the inside out. Until the disease is cured, at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease."
