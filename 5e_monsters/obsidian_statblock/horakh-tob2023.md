"traits":
- "desc": "If the horakh reduces a creature to 0 hp with a Bite attack or as a bonus action while within 5 feet of a creature with 0 hp, the horakh can implant an egg in the creature. The implanted egg rests in the creature’s eye socket for 14 days while it incubates. A host creature can carry only one horakh egg to term at a time. While the egg is implanted, the host can’t use its eye and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Exactly 24 hours before the egg hatches, the host becomes blinded. When the egg hatches, the young horakh erupts from the host’s head, killing the host in the process."

While missing half or less of its total number of eyes, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. While missing more than half its total number of eyes, the target is blinded until its sight is restored."
