A creature that is immune to cold damage doesn’t suffer exhaustion, even if it fails the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is petrified in ice for 1 minute. A petrified creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
