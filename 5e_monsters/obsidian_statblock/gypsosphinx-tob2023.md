"traits":
- "desc": "The sphinx can pinpoint, by scent, the location of each creature below half its hp maximum within 60 feet of it, and it can sense the general direction of creatures that don’t have all of their hp within 1 mile of it. In addition, the sphinx can foretell the age and manner of a creature’s death by looking at it. This effect doesn’t take into account possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of powerful spells or the creature making a radical change in its life’s path."
  "name": "Death Sense"
- "desc": "The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the sphinx’s intentions or sincerity have disadvantage."

- "desc": "The sphinx’s weapon attacks are magical."
  "name": "Magic Weapons"

On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. While poisoned in this way, a creature has disadvantage on death saving throws. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
