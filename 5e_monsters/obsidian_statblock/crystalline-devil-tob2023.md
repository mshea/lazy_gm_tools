While charmed, a creature is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the devil by the safest route, trying to get within 5 feet of the devil to hold it. The charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

  "name": "Betraying Carbuncle"
- "desc": "The crystalline devil magically calls one jewel-encrusted, fiendish animated armor that has the crystalline devil’s damage resistances and immunities. The crystalline devil has a 25 percent chance of calling one crystalline devil instead. The called creature arrives in 1d4 rounds, acting as an ally of the devil and obeying its telepathic commands. The creature remains for 1 hour, until the devil dies, or until the devil dismisses it as a bonus action."
