If the sand silhouette moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The sand silhouette can have only one creature engulfed at a time."
  "name": "Engulf"
- "desc": "The sand silhouette creates a storm of whirling sand and wailing souls around itself. The storm is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder centered on the silhouette and moves with the silhouette for 1 minute, until it ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The sandstorm’s area is lightly obscured, and a creature that starts its turn in the sandstorm’s area or enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and be frightened for 1 minute. An engulfed creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
