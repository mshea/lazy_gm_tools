- "desc": "Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

A darakhul using this ability can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise."

If the target is a creature other than an Undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.
