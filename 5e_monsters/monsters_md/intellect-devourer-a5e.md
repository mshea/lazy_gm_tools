### Actions

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Ego Whip:** The intellect devourer targets a creature with a brain within 60 feet. The target makes a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure  it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is rattled for 1 minute. If it is already rattled by Ego Whip  it is also stunned. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending both effects on a success.
- **Body Thief:** The intellect devourer enters the nose and mouth of an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet. The target must be Small or larger  have a brain  and have an Intelligence of 4 or higher. The intellect devourer eats the targets brain and takes control of the target. The intellect devourer leaves the body if the target is reduced to 0 hit points  if the target is affected by dispel evil and good or another effect that ends possession  or voluntarily as a bonus action. A creature killed by the intellect devourer can be restored to life by resurrection or similar magic.
- **While the intellect devourer is in control of the target, the intellect devourer retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, its telepathy, and its knowledge of Deep Speech:** It otherwise uses the targets statistics  including proficiencies  languages  class features  and spells. It has vague knowledge about the targets life but must make a DC 15 Intelligence check to recall specific facts.
