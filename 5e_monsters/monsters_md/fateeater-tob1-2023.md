### Special Abilities

- **Visionary Flesh:** A creature that eats the flesh of a fate eater must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 hour. On a success, the creature gains the benefits of the divination spell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fate eater makes two Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Alter Fate (Recharge 5-6):** The fate eater alters the fate of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 (8d8) psychic damage, and its fate is altered. Roll a d6 to determine which of the following alterations affects the creature. On a success, the creature takes half the damage, and its fate isn't altered. A creature with an altered fate for 1 minute or less can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, a creature with an altered fate can repeat the saving throw at the end of each long rest, ending the effect on itself on a success.
