- **Multiattack:** The knight attacks three times with their greatsword.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Lance (Mounted Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d12 + 3) piercing damage. If the knight moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  they deal an extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage  and the target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. This attack is made at disadvantage against targets within 5 feet.

- **Vile Curse (1/Day):** The knight utters hellish words that scald the soul. Living creatures of the knights choice within 30 feet that can hear and understand them are magically cursed for 1 minute. A d4 is subtracted from attack rolls and saving throws made by a cursed creature. A creature immune to the frightened condition is immune to this curse.
