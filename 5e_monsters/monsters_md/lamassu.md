### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The lamassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The lamassu's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Pounce:** If the lamassu moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the lamassu can make one claw attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The lamassu's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect evil and good, mage hand, magic circle, sacred flame, unseen servant

1/day each: banishment, flame strike, glyph of warding

- **Healing Touch (3/Day):** The lamassu touches a creature. The target magically regains 22 (5d8) hp and is cured of any curses or diseases and of any poisoned, blinded, or deafened conditions afflicting it.

The lamassu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lamassu regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
