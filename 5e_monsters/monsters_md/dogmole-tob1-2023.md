### Special Abilities

- **Burrowed Tunnels:** If the dogmole burrows at half its burrowing speed, it can leave a 5-foot diameter tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dogmole makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **Wormkiller Rage:** When the dogmole takes damage from a Small or larger insectoid Beast, such as a giant centipede, or when it deals damage to such a creature, it enters a special rage for 3 rounds. While in this rage, it has advantage on attack rolls and Strength checks and deals an extra 2 (1d4) piercing damage with its Bite attack, but its Armor Class is reduced by 2. The dogmole can't end this rage willingly.
