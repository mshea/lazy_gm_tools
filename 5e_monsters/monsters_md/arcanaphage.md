### Special Abilities

- **Arcane Discharge:** When an arcanaphage dies, it explodes in a surge of partially-digested magical energy. Each creature within 5 feet per Feed score must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) force damage per Feed score on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For 1 minute afterward, the affected area is awash with volatile magic. A creature that starts its turn in the affected area takes 7 (2d6) force damage.
- **Hunger:** Each time it feeds in combat, it regains hp equal to twice the level of the spell it ate and increases its Feed score by 1. The arcanaphage can't have a Feed score higher than 8, and its Feed score reduces by 1 each time it finishes a long rest.
- **Ingest Magic:** At the start of each of the arcanaphage's turns, each creature within 30 feet of it that is currently maintaining concentration on a spell must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's spell ends and the arcanaphage feeds.
- **Magic Immunity:** The arcanaphage is immune to damage from spells. It has advantage on saving throws against all other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The arcanaphage makes two tentacle attacks.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

- **Voracious:** The arcanaphage's tentacles glow when a spell is cast within 30 feet of it, countering the spell. This reaction works like the counterspell spell, except the arcanaphage must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell level. Its ability check for this is +5. If it successfully counters the spell, the arcanaphage feeds.
