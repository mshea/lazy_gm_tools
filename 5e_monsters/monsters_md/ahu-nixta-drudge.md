### Special Abilities

- **Clockwork Encasement:** The creature within the machine is a somewhat shapeless mass, both protected and given concrete manipulators by its armor. The clockwork armor has a few manipulators that the ahu-nixta can use to attack or to interact with objects outside of the armor. Unlike other ahu-nixta, the drudge can't live outside its armor and dies when its armor is reduced to 0 hp.
- **Immutable Form:** The drudge's clockwork armor is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form, as is the creature that controls it as long as the ahu-nixta remains within the armor.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The ahu-nixta's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 11, +3 to hit with spell attacks). The ahunixta can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: fire bolt  (1d10)
1/day: fear

### Actions

- **Whirring Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.
