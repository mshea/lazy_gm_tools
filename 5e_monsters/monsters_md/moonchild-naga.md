### Special Abilities

- **Rejuvenation:** If it dies, the moonchild naga returns to life in 1d6 days and regains all its hp. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The moonchild naga's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
At will: charm person, friends, mage hand, message, minor illusion, poison spray, suggestion
3/day each: color spray, dispel magic, fear, hold person
1/day each: dominate beast, hypnotic pattern

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the naga can't constrict another target.
- **Starry Gaze:** The moonchild naga's bottomless gaze inexorably draws the eye of one target within 30 feet. If the target can see the naga, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the naga's next turn. If the target's saving throw is successful, it is immune to the naga's gaze for the next 24 hours.
