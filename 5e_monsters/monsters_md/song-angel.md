### Special Abilities

- **Angelic Weapons:** The song angel's weapon attacks are magical. When the song angel hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The angel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: alter self, calm emotions, charm person, create food and water, detect evil and good
3/day each: enthrall, silence, zone of truth
1/day each: irresistible dance, mass cure wounds

### Actions

- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.
- **Horn of Blasting (Recharges 5-6):** The song angel blows on its ram's horn, emitting a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 17 (5d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 35 (10d6) thunder damage instead.
- **Horn of Spirits (Recharges after a Long Rest):** The song angel blows on its brass horn, calling forth 10 (3d4 + 3) warrior spirits. These spirits appear within 60 feet of the angel and use tribal warrior statistics. When the spirits are summoned, one of them is always an ancient champion that uses berserker statistics. They disappear after 1 hour or when they are reduced to 0 hp. These spirits follow the angel's commands.
- **Change Shape:** The angel magically polymorphs into a humanoid that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the angel's choice).<br><br>In the new form, the angel retains its game statistics and the ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

### Reactions

- **Heavenly Inspiration:** When a creature the song angel can see fails an ability check or saving throw or misses with a weapon attack, the angel can sing a verse of divine music. If the creature hears this song, it can reroll the failed check, save, or attack roll with advantage.
