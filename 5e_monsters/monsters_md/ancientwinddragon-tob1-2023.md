### Special Abilities

- **Freedom of Movement:** The dragon ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Storm Sight:** The dragon can see through areas obscured by fog, mist, clouds, or precipitation.
- **Whirling Winds:** Gale force winds rage around the dragon's body. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at the dragon are deflected upward and automatically miss. Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wind dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. it: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Tempest Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a blast of stormy wind in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and 36 (8d8) lightning damage and is pushed up to 45 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or knocked prone. Nonmagical flames in the area are extinguished.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a Tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
