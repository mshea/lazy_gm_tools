### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the forest hunter is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half the damage, the hunter instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half the damage if it fails.
- **Fey Ancestry:** The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.
- **Forest and Urban Hunter:** The forest hunter has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to find and track Beasts and Humanoids.
- **Charging Archer:** If the forest hunter moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target after hitting the target with a Longbow attack, the forest hunter can make one Dagger attack against the target as a bonus action.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shadow fey makes two Dagger or Longbow attacks.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Traveler (3/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
