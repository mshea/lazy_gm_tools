### Special Abilities

- **Master Tactician:** The monarch skeleton and any skeletons within 30 feet of it have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the skeleton's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Sovereign's Command:** As a bonus action, the monarch commands a skeleton within 30 feet of it to make one attack as a reaction against a creature the monarch attacked this round.
- **Turning Defiance:** The monarch skeleton and any skeletons within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The monarch skeleton makes two dreadblade attacks.
- **Dreadblade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Grasp of the Grave (Recharge 5-6):** Each non-skeleton creature within 30 feet of the monarch must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by ghostly, skeletal hands for 1 minute. A restrained target takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature, including the target, can take its action to break the ghostly restraints by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.
