### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The otyugh makes two tentacle attacks.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 14) and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles  each of which can grapple one target and can't attack a different target while doing so.
- **Tentacle Slam:** The otyugh slams any creatures it is grappling into a hard surface or into each other. Each creature makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failure  the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage  is stunned until the end of the otyughs next turn  and is pulled up to 5 feet towards the otyugh. On a success  the target takes half damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target contracts a disease. While diseased, the target is poisoned. The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success. The reduction in hit points lasts until the disease is cured.
- **Swallow:** If the otyugh has no other creature in its stomach, the otyugh bites a Medium or smaller creature that is stunned. On a hit, the creature is swallowed. A swallowed creature has total cover from attacks from outside the otyugh, is blinded and restrained, and takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the otyugh's turns. If a swallowed creature deals 15 or more damage to the otyugh in a single turn, or if the otyugh dies, the otyugh vomits up the creature.
