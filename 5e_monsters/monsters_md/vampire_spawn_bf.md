### Special Abilities

- **Hungry Dead Nature:** As the **vampire**.
- **Regeneration:** The vampire spawn regains 10 HP at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 HP and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
- **Resting Place:** As the **vampire**.
- **Spider Climb:** As the **vampire**.
- **Vampire Weaknesses:** As the **vampire**.
- **Vampiric Resilience:** The vampire is immune to exhaustion.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vampire spawn makes two Claw attacks. It can replace one attack with a Draining Bite attack. If both Claw attacks hit one Large or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 14).
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.
- **Draining Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's HP maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains HP equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its HP maximum to 0.

### Bonus Actions

- **Call Blood:** The vampire calls to the blood within one injured creature it can see within 10 feet of it, causing blood to pour from the creature's wounds. If the target doesn't have all its HP, it must make a DC 14 CON save, losing 7 (2d6) HP on a failed save, or losing half as much HP on a successful one. Before the end of its next turn, the vampire has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against a creature that failed the save.
