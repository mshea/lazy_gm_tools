### Special Abilities

- **Cat Telepathy:** The shadow boxer can magically communicate with cats within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.
- **Pounce:** If the shadow boxer moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the shadow boxer can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Project Silhouette:** As a bonus action, the shadow boxer projects a shadow on a surface within 60 feet of it. The shadow boxer can shape it to resemble the shadow of any Medium or smaller beast, but the shadow can't be larger than a 10-foot cube. Each creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the shadow and that can see the shadow must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn and use its movement on its next turn to follow the shadow. As a bonus action, the shadow boxer can move the shadow up to 30 feet along a solid surface. The shadow moves in a natural manner for the type of creature it represents.

### Actions

- **Invisibility:** The shadow boxer magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the shadow boxer wears or carries is invisible with it.
