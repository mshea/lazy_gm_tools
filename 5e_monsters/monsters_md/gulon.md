### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The gulon can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing. When it moves through an area smaller than its normal space, it excretes waste in a 5-foot cube. This waste is difficult terrain and creatures crossing through it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.
- **Keen Smell:** The gulon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gulon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Too Full (Recharge 5-6):** The gulon belches a 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic gas around itself. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
