- **Quip:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, 60 ft., one target, 14 (3d6+4) psychic.
- **Fast Talk:** The merchant captain baffles a creature it can see within 30' of it with barrage of jargon quick speech and big words. The target must make DC 15 Cha save or have disadvantage on the next Wis save it makes before the end of the merchant captain's next turn.
- **Spellcasting:** Cha (DC 15): At will: comprehend languages mage hand mending3/day ea: calm emotions enthrall heroism1/day ea: confusion freedom of movement

### Reactions

- **Inspiration (4/Day):** When a creature within 30' of the merchant captain fails an attack roll ability check or save the captain can force it to reroll the die. The target must use the new roll.
