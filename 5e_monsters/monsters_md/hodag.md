### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the hodag moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Improved Critical:** The hodag's teeth, claws, horns, and tail spikes are extra sharp. These weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
- **Keen Hearing and Smell:** The hodag has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hodag makes three melee attacks, but can use its bite and horn attacks only once each.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Horns:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Territorial Display (Recharge 6):** The hodag rears and stomps on the ground then roars a territorial challenge. Each creature within 10 feet of the hodag must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also knocked prone.
