### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The pale screamer can breathe air and water.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pale screamer makes two tentacle attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Scream of the Deep (Recharge 6):** The pale screamer unleashes an alien screech in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and is deafened until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened.
