### Special Abilities

- **Siege Monster:** The ychen bannog deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ychen bannog makes one Gore attack and two Stomp attacks.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (3d10 + 9) piercing damage. If the ychen bannog scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Deafening Bellow (Recharge 5-6):** The ychen bannog delivers a fearsome bellow in a 60-foot cone that is audible out to 1 mile. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.
- **Overrun (Recharge 6):** The ychen bannog moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The first time the ychen bannog enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 54 (12d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
