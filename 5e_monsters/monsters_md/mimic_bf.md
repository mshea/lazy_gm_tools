### Special Abilities

- **Adhesive (Object Form Only):** The mimic adheres to anything that touches it. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the mimic is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
- **False Appearance (Object Form Only):** While the mimic remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
- **Grappler:** The mimic has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by it.
- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The mimic is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The mimic makes two Pseudopod attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can replace one attack with a Bite attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled creature. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage.
- **Pseudopod:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage. If the mimic is in object form, the target is subjected to its Adhesive trait.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The mimic transforms into a Large or smaller object or back into its true, amorphous form, which is a Monstrosity. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

### Reactions

- **Prey Shield:** When a creature the mimic can see hits it with an attack while it is grappling a creature, the mimic can roll the grappled creature in front of the blow, forcing the grappled creature to take the damage instead.
