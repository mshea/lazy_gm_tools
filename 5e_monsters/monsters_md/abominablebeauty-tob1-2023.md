### Special Abilities

- **Burning Touch:** When the abominable beauty hits with a Slam attack, the Slam deals an extra 21 (6d6) fire damage (included in the attack). In addition, a creature that touches the abominable beauty or hits her with a melee weapon attack while within 5 feet of her takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The abominable beauty uses Blinding Gaze. She then makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) fire damage.
- **Blinding Gaze:** The abominable beauty fixes her gaze on a creature within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the beauty's eyes, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the abominable beauty's Blinding Gaze for the next 24 hours.
- **Deafening Voice (Recharge 5-6):** The abominable beauty speaks a lilting incantation. Each creature within 30 feet of her and that can hear her voice must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 31 (9d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn't deafened, and is immune to the abominable beauty's Deafening Voice for the next 24 hours.
