- **Planar Weapons:** Its weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon weapon deals extra 3d8 damage of the type chosen with Planar Attunement (included below).
- **Planes Hunter:** Has advantage on Wis (Perception) and Wis (Survival) checks to find and track Celestials Fiends and Elementals.
- **Snaring Blade:** If it scores a critical hit vs. a creature target can't use any method of extradimensional movement including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence for 1 min. The creature can make a DC 16 Cha save at the end of each of its turns ending effect on itself on a success.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Longsword attacks.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage or 9 (1d10+4) slashing damage if used with two hands + 13 (3d8) acid cold fire lightning necrotic radiant or thunder (see Planar Attunement).
- **Warping Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6):** Bends reality around it slicing nearby creatures with sword strikes from across the planes. Each creature within 10 ft. of the planes hunter must make a DC 16 Dex save taking 18 (4d8) slashing damage and 18 (4d8) acid cold fire lightning necrotic radiant or thunder (see Planar Attunement) on a failed save or half damage if made.
- **Planar Traveler (1/Day):** Can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell except hunter can only affect itself and can't use this action to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
