### Special Abilities

- **Devil's Sight:** Magical darkness doesn't impede the lemure's darkvision.
- **Devilish Resilience:** The devil is resistant to cold damage. In addition, it is immune to fire damage and poison damage and to the poisoned condition.
- **Hellish Rejuvenation:** Unlike other outsiders, a lemure that dies in its home plane of the Hells is restored in a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its HP and becoming active again. The new body appears in the Hells within 1 mile of where it was slain. Only sprinkling holy water on the lemure's remains can prevent this trait from functioning.

### Actions

- **Fist:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Rippling Heat (1/Day):** The lemure exudes an aura of extreme heat for 1 minute. Each creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the lemure and that isn't a devil must succeed on a DC 11 CON save or be weakened until the start of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on all attack rolls, and it deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more suffers one level of exhaustion. A creature that has suffered a level of exhaustion from this lemure's Rippling Heat can't suffer another level from this lemure's Rippling Heat for 24 hours.
