### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The living wick doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Wick-Powered:** The living wick is inactive and unconscious while its wick is unlit. When its wick is lit, it obeys the commands of the creature that lit the wick, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The living wick's hp maximum is reduced by 2 (1d4) for every 24 hours it remains lit and active, and no effect short of a wish spell can remove this reduction. The living wick dies when its hp maximum is reduced to 0.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
- **Consuming Inferno:** The living wick's controller can command the living wick to rapidly burn through the remains of its wick, creating a devastating ball of fire. Each creature within 20 feet of the living wick must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the area and that aren't being worn or carried ignite. The living wick then dies, becoming a lifeless puddle of wax.
