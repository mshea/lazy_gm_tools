### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The leonino doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Evasion:** If the leonino is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the leonino instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Silent Wings:** The flight of a leonine is especially silent and difficult to notice in forests and urban settings. It has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while flying in these areas.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. If this is the first time the leonino has hit the target within the past 24 hours, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the leonino for 1 hour.
