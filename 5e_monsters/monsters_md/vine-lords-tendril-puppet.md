### Special Abilities
- **Poor Vision:** Tendril puppets see almost nothing beyond 30 feet away.
- **Regeneration:** The tendril puppet regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and is in jungle terrain.
- **Root Mind:** Within a vine lord's forest or jungle, the tendril puppet's blindsight extends to 60 feet, it succeeds on all Wisdom (Perception) checks, and it can't be surprised.
- **Green Strider:** The tendril puppet ignores movement restrictions and damage caused by natural undergrowth.
- **Magic Resistance:** The tendril puppet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
### Actions
- **Assegai:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, or 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Hurl Thorns:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the thorn explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the target. Every creature in the affected area other than the original target takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
