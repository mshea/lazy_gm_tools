### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the centaur moves at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a pike attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) piercing damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The centaur chieftain makes two attacks: one with its pike and one with its hooves or two with its longbow.
- **Pike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the centaur chieftain can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the centaur chieftain. A creature can benefit from only one
- **Leadership die at a time:** This effect ends if the centaur chieftain is incapacitated.
- **Rearing Strike (Recharge 5-6):** The centaur chieftain rears back on its hind legs and makes a powerful stomp with its hooves. Each creature within 15 feet of the chieftain must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The attack leaves the centaur chieftain vulnerable, reducing its<br>Armor Class by 2 until the start of its next turn.
