### Special Abilities

- **Blind Senses:** The jiangshi can't use its blindsight while deafened.
- **Keen Hearing:** The jiangshi has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
- **Prayer of Magic Resistance:** The jiangshi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. A creature can take its action while within 5 feet of the jiangshi to rip the prayer off the jiangshi by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. The jiangshi loses this trait if its prayer scroll is removed.
- **Standing Leap:** The jiangshi's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.
- **Terrifying Appearance:** When a creature that can see the jiangshi starts its turn within 30 feet of the jiangshi, it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, unless the jiangshi is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the jiangshi's Terrifying Appearance for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The jiangshi makes two claw attacks. It can use Life Drain in place of one claw attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the jiangshi doesn't have two other creatures grappled.
- **Life Drain:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is grappled by the jiangshi, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. <br><br>A humanoid slain in this way rises 24 hours later as a jiangshi, unless the humanoid is restored to life, its body is bathed in vinegar before burial, or its body is destroyed.
