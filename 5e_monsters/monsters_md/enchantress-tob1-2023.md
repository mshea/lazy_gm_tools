### Special Abilities

- **Fey Ancestry:** The enchantress has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep.
- **Phrenic Weapons:** The enchantress's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage (included in the attack).
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Beguiling Whispers (Recharge 5-6):** The enchantress speaks sweet words to a creature she can see within 60 feet of her and that can hear her. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against spells cast by the enchantress.
- **Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** For 1 minute, the enchantress can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that she can see within 30 feet of her makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the enchantress. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the enchantress is incapacitated.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Traveler (3/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
