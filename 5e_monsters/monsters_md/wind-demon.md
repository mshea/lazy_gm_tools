### Special Abilities

- **Arrow Bane:** When the wind demon is targeted by an attack or spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. On a 6, the wind demon is unaffected, and the attack is reflected back at the attacker as though it originated from the wind demon, turning the attacker into the target.
- **Magic Resistance:** The wind demon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wind demon makes two frost claw attacks.
- **Frost Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

### Reactions

- **Swift as Frost:** After a creature the wind demon can see damages it with an attack, the wind demon can move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
