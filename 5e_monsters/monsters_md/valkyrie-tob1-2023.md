### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Valor:** Friendly creatures wielding weapons within 30 feet of the valkyrie have advantage on weapon attack rolls and ability checks. At the start of each of its turns, the valkyrie can choose to exclude any number of friendly creatures from this aura (no action required).
- **Immortal Nature:** The valkyrie doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
- **Magic Resistance:** The valkyrie has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Radiant Weapons:** The valkyrie's weapon attacks are magical. When it hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 16 (3d10) radiant damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The valkyrie can use its Gaze of Doom. It then makes two Longsword attacks and one Spear attack, or it makes three Radiant Bolt attacks.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 16 (3d10) radiant damage.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 16 (3d10) radiant damage.
- **Radiant Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d10 + 4) radiant damage.
- **Gaze of Doom:** The valkyrie's gaze foretells a doomed fate for one creature the valkyrie can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Healing Touch (4/Day):** The valkyrie touches another creature. The target magically regains 21 (6d6) hp and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

### Reactions

- **Ascension:** When a friendly creature the valkyrie can see and within its Aura of Valor is reduced to 0 hp while engaged in melee combat, the valkyrie can reincarnate the creature as a gladiator. If the gladiator reduces at least three creatures to 0 hp within 1 minute of its reincarnation, it transforms into an einherjar. The valkyrie can provide ascension to up to two creatures each hour with this reaction.
