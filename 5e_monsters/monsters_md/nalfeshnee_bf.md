- **Horrific Nimbus:** The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating, multicolored light that disorients and frightens mortals. Each creature that isn't an Aberration, Celestial, or Fiend and that starts its turn within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee must succeed on a DC 16 WIS save or be frightened until the start of its next turn. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more must take the Dash action on its turn and move away from the nalfeshnee by the safest available route, unless there is nowhere to move.
