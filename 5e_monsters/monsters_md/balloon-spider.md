### Special Abilities

- **Erratic Discharge:** A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the balloon spider must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 2 (1d4) lightning damage and can move or take an action on its turn, but not both. On a success, the creature gains the benefits of the haste spell until the end of its turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, it is immune to the spider's Erratic Discharge for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) lightning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or it can move or take an action on its turn, but not both.
- **Charged Web (Recharge 4-6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 40/80 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 13) by strands of charged webbing and begins to hover off the ground. Until this grapple ends, the target takes 1 lightning damage at the start of each of its turns. In addition, the grappled target can make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to manipulate the strands of webbing and fly 10 feet in any direction.
- **Draw In:** The balloon spider magically pulls all creatures grappled by its webbing up to 10 feet toward it. If this movement pulls the creature within 5 feet of the balloon spider, the spider can make one bite attack against the creature as a bonus action.
