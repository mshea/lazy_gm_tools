### Special Abilities

- **Regeneration:** The vine troll skeleton regains 5 hp at the start of its turn. If the skeleton takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the skeleton's next turn. The skeleton dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate or if its bound tree is destroyed (see Tree Bound trait).
- **Tree Bound:** The vine troll skeleton is magically bound to a duskthorn dryad, tree, or treant, and the skeleton must stay within 1 mile of it. If the skeleton's bound duskthorn dryad, tree, or treant dies, the skeleton is immediately destroyed and doesn't regenerate.
- **Undead Nature:** The vine troll skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
