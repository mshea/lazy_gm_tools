### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the sarsaok moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 13 (3d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Divine Horns:** The sarsaok's gore attack is magical. In addition, its gore attack ignores the target's resistances to piercing or fire damage.
- **Heated Body:** Any creature that touches the sarsaok or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sarsaok makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its hooves.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Immolating Purge (Recharge 5-6):** The sarsaok spews burning blood in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
