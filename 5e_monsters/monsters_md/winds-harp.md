### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the wind's harp devil remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary object.
- **Magic Resistance:** The wind's harp devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Strong Winds:** The wind's harp devil has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of its allies is an air elemental, wind demon, or similar creature of air, is within 20 feet of the target, and isn't incapacitated. rP

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wind's harp devil makes two infernal noise attacks.
- **Infernal Noise:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) psychic damage plus 3 (1d6) thunder damage.
- **Hellish Chorus (Recharge 5-6):** The wind's harp devil creates an infernal cacophony. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) psychic damage and 7 (2d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Devils are immune to the hellish chorus.

### Reactions

- **Diabolical Countersong:** When a spell is cast within 60 feet of it, the wind's harp devil plays a single, infernal note, interrupting the spell. This reaction works like the counterspell spell, except it only works on spells of 3rd level or lower.
