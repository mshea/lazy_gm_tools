If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 STR save or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the skeleton and knocked prone.
- **False Appearance:** While the minotaur skeleton remains motionless and prone, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate minotaur skeleton.
- **Labyrinthine Memories:** The minotaur skeleton has advantage on checks and saves to avoid becoming lost or to recall a path it has previously traveled.
- **Undead Nature:** The skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Undead Resilience:** The skeleton is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.
