### Special Abilities

- **Trader:** The far wanderer understands the literal meaning of any spoken or written language it hears or reads. In addition, it can use an action to read the surface thoughts of one creature within 30 feet. This works like the detect thoughts spell, except it can only read surface thoughts and there is no limit to the duration. It can end this effect as a bonus action or by using an action to change the target.
- **Traveler:** As a bonus action, the far wanderer folds the fabric of reality to teleport itself to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A brief shimmer of starlight appears at the origin and destination.

### Actions

- **Stardust Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) slashing damage and 2 (1d4) cold damage.
- **Stardust bow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage and 2 (1d4) cold damage.
- **Call to Yorama (1/Day):** The far wanderer channels the energy of the living god-star Yorama. One creature the far wanderer can see within 60 feet must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature who fails the saving throw is stunned until the end of its turn. Alternately, the far wanderer can instead restore 14 (4d6) hp to one willing creature it can see within 60 feet.
