### Special Abilities

- **Toxic Ichor:** While submerged in water it's ichor taints water within 10 ft. of it. When a creature enters area for the 1st time on a turn or starts its turn there that creature must make DC 15 Con save or be poisoned while it remains in area and for 1 min after it leaves. A poisoned creature that is no longer in the water can re-save at end of each of its turns ending effect on itself on a success. If purify food and drink spell is cast on a space within 5 ft. of lotus or on space it occupies trait ceases to function for 1 min.
- **Undead Nature:** Doesn't require air food drink or sleep.
- **Waterwalker:** Can walk across surface of water as if it were solid ground. Otherwise works like water walk but isn't itself magical.

While a reflection speed is 5 ft. can't use Tainted Claw and can revert to its true form as a bonus action. If it takes damage that isn't bludgeoning piercing or slashing while a reflection forced back into its true form.
