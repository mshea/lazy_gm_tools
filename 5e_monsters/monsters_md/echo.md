### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Cacophony:** The demon's presence is extremely distracting. Each creature within 100 feet of the echo demon and that can hear it has disadvantage on concentration checks.

### Actions

- **Iron Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage and if the creature is wearing metal armor, it must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be deafened until the end of its next turn.
- **Everywhere at Once (Recharge 5-6):** The echo demon teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space. Immediately after teleporting, it can make an iron claws attack with advantage as a bonus action.
- **Echoes of the Abyss (1/Day):** The echo demon summons horrible wails from the deep crevasses of the Abyss. Creatures within 60 feet who can hear the wails must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the start of the echo demon's next turn. An affected creature continues hearing the troubling echoes of these cries until it finishes a long rest, and it has disadvantage on Intelligence checks until then.
