### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If Azi Dahaka fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Magic Resistance:** Azi Dahaka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Multiple Heads:** Azi Dahaka's three heads grant it advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
- **Reactive Heads:** Azi Dahaka gets two extra reactions that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
- **Vermin Blood:** A creature that hits Azi Dahaka with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 4 (1d8) piercing damage and 4 (1d8) poison damage as the dragon's blood becomes biting and stinging vermin.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Azi Dahaka makes three bite attacks and two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Storm Breath (Recharge 5-6):** Azi Dahaka exhales a blast of wind and lightning in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and 18 (4d8) lightning damage, is pushed 25 feet away from Azi Dahaka, and is knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning and lightning damage and is pushed, but isn't knocked prone. All nonmagical flames in the cone are extinguished.

Azi Dahaka can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Azi Dahaka regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Control Weather:** Azi Dahaka can alter the weather in a 5-mile radius centered on itself. The effect is identical to the control weather spell, except the casting time and effects are immediate. Call Lightning (Cost 2 Actions). A bolt of lightning flashes down from the clouds to a point Azi Dahaka can see within 100 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** Azi Dahaka beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Azi Dahaka can then fly up to half its flying speed.
