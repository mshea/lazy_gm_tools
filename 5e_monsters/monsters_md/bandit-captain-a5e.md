### Reactions

- **Parry:** If the bandit captain is wielding a melee weapon and can see their attacker, they add 2 to their AC against one melee attack that would hit them.
- **Bandits are outlaws who live by violence:** Most are highway robbers, though a few are principled exiles or freedom fighters.
