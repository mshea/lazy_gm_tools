### Special Abilities

- **Indiscernible in Shadows:** While in dim light or darkness, the bleakheart is invisible.
- **Silent Entry (3/Day):** As a bonus action, the bleakheart can silently unlock a door within 10 feet of it that is held shut by a mundane lock. If a door has multiple locks, only one is unlocked per use of this trait.
- **Sunlight Weakness:** While in sunlight, the bleakheart has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The bleakheart's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: detect thoughts, minor illusion
3/day each: disguise self

### Actions

- **Disheartening Touch:** Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
- **Steal Joy (Recharge 5-6):** Each creature of the bleakheart's choice that is within 20 feet of the bleakheart and aware of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or its Charisma score is reduced by 1d4. A creature that has taken psychic damage from the bleakheart's Disheartening Touch within the last minute has disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature that has its Charisma reduced to 0 ends its life at the earliest opportunity, and a new bleakheart rises from its corpse 1d4 hours later. Otherwise, the Charisma reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
