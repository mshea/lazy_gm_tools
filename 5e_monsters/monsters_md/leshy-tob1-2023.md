### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The leshy can mimic animal sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Plant Camouflage:** The leshy has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.
- **Speak with Beasts and Plants:** The leshy can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they shared a language.
- **Vine-Wrapped Weapons:** The poisonous vines growing from the leshy entwine around its weapon. When the leshy hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d4 poison damage (included in the attack).
- **Woodland Stride:** Difficult terrain composed of magical or nonmagical plants doesn't cost the leshy extra movement.

### Actions

- **Club:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) poison damage.
- **Frightening Mien (Recharge 5-6):** The leshy briefly appears to grow to an enormous size, taking on a malicious mien before returning to normal. Each creature within 15 feet of the leshy and that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature is immune to Frightening Mien if it can see through illusions.
- **Encourage Growth (1/Day):** The leshy whispers magical words of growth to nonmagical plants on a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The plants burst with life and spread rapidly. The area within 20 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain for 24 hours.
- **Familiar:** The library automaton can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the automaton senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the automaton is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion has resistance to psychic damage. At any time and for any reason, the automaton can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
