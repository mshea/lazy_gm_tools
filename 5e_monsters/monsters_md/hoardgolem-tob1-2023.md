### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Enchanted Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical. When the golem hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 force damage (included in the attack).
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Strike with Awe:** A creature that enters a space within 120 feet of the hoard golem or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while it remains within 120 feet of the golem.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hoard golem makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage.
- **Thieving Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6):** The hoard golem partially disperses into a whirlwind of coins, gemstones, and other valuables then recoalesces. Each creature within 20 feet of the golem must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and loses one object it is wearing or carrying. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't lose an object. Each object the golem steals must weigh no more than 20 pounds and not be wrapped around or firmly attached to a creature. For example, the golem could steal a belt pouch full of coins or a creature's jewel-encrusted dagger, but it can't steal a creature's shirt or armor. The hoard golem steals objects of high value over those of minimal value. The stolen object becomes part of the golem's body and can't be retrieved until the golem dies.
