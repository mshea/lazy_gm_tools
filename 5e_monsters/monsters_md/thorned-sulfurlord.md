### Special Abilities

- **Burning Tangle:** The ground within 10 feet of the thorned sulfurlord is difficult terrain.
- **Hell Core:** At the start of each of the thorned sulfurlord's turns, each creature within 10 feet of the sulfurlord takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the thorned sulfurlord takes cold damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn.
- **Like Calls to Like:** The thorned sulfurlord knows if a creature within 100 feet of it is evil-aligned or not.
- **Root (3/Day):** As a bonus action, the thorned sulfurlord sends its roots deep into the ground. For 1 minute, the sulfurlord's speed is halved, it is immune to effects that would move it, and it can't be knocked prone.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The thorned sulfurlord makes two sulfur slam attacks or two fiery spike attacks.
- **Sulfur Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Fiery Spike:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (3d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage.
- **The World Shall Know Fire (Recharge 5-6):** The thorned sulfurlord targets a creature that has taken fire damage from it within the last minute and causes a burst of fire to expand out from that creature in a 30-foot-radius. Each creature in the area, including the target, must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
