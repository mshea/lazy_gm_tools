### Special Abilities

- **Suffocating Heat:** After the brass dragon uses its Fire Breath, the air around it is devoid of moisture and lacking in breathable air. While the dragon's Fire Breath is unavailable, each creature that requires air to breathe, other than the dragon, and that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or begin suffocating. A creature that fails this save for two consecutive rounds falls unconscious until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Sleep Breath, if available.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d10+4) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 DEX save, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Sleep Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 CON save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
