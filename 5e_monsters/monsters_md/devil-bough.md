### Special Abilities

- **Grinding Maw:** The devil bough has advantage on attack rolls against any creature grappled by its bite attack.
- **Like Calls to Like:** The devil bough knows if a creature within 60 feet of it is evil-aligned or not.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The devil bough makes one claw attack and one bite attack.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and the devil bough can't make bite attacks against other targets.

### Reactions

- **Arcasynthesis:** When a spell of 5th level or lower is cast within 100 feet of the devil bough, it attempts to synthesize the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but the devil bough has a 50% chance of regaining 5 (1d10) hp per level of the spell cast.
