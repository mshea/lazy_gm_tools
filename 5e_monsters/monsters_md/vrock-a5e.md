### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vrock attacks with its beak and its talons.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the vrock has advantage on the attack roll  it deals an additional 7 (2d6) damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Spores (1/Day):** A 15-foot-radius cloud of spores emanates from the vrock  spreading around corners. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw  becoming poisoned for 1 minute on a failure. While poisoned in this way  the target takes ongoing 5 (1d10) poison damage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Stunning Screech (1/Day):** The vrock screeches. Each non-demon creature within 20 feet that can hear it makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is stunned until the end of the vrocks next turn.
