### Special Abilities

- **Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only):** If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a Slam or Tusks attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage of the weapon's type. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** The wereboar makes three Maul or Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a Tusks attack, provided it is in the appropriate form. If two Maul or Slam attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
- **Maul (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Slam (Boar or Hybrid Form Only):** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Tusks (Boar or Hybrid Form Only):** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 CON save or be cursed with the wereboar lycanthropy curse (see Curse of Lycanthropy sidebar).

### Bonus Actions

- **Challenging Snort (Boar or Hybrid Form Only):** The wereboar snorts and stomps its feet at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn and have disadvantage on the next save it makes against being knocked prone by the wereboar.
- **Change Shape:** The wereboar transforms into a Medum or Large boar, a Medium boar-humanoid hybrid, or back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, speed, and AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
