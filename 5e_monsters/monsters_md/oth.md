- **Multiple Roles:** Choose either the Dripping Arcanist or Paladin of Shoth trait. 
* Dripping Arcanist. The oth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell casting DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It may cast the following spells innately, requiring only verbal components: _
Cantrip (at will): fire bolt (2d10), light, thaumaturgy _
3/day each: command, mage armor, magic missile _
2/day each: augury, detect thoughts _
1/day: fireball
* Paladin of Shoth. The oth derives its power from Shoth itself, its zom shining with sacred light. Its Armor Class increases by 2. A non-shoth creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the oth must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded by the light of Shoth until the end of its turn.

- **Merge:** A shoth who has less than half its maximum hp can merge with any other shoth creature within 10 feet, adding its remaining hp to that creature's. The hp gained this way can exceed the normal maximum of that creature. A shoth can accept one such merger every 24 hours.
- **Spray (Recharge 6):** The oth sprays acid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
