### Special Abilities
- **Hive Mind:** Spawn of Arbeyach share a bond with other members of their hive that enhances their hive mates' perception. As long as a spawn is within 60 feet of at least one hive mate, it has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. If one spawn is aware of a particular danger, all others in the hive are, too. No spawn in a hive mind is surprised at the beginning of an encounter unless all of them are.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The spawn of Arbeyach's spellcasting ability is Charisma. The Spawn of Arbeyach can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 1/day: conjure animals (only swarms of insects) Scent Communication. Spawn of Arbeyach can communicate with each other and all swarms of insects within 60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication that only Arbeyach, spawn of Arbeyach, and swarms of insects can understand. As a bonus action, the spawn of Arbeyach can use this trait to control and give orders to one swarm of insects within 60 feet.
