### Special Abilities

- **Keen Sight:** The graknork has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The graknork makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use its Eye Ray twice. If both claw attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take an additional 9 (2d8) slashing damage and be knocked prone.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage.
- **Eye Ray:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (5d6) cold damage.
- **Freezing Eye (Recharge 5-6):** The graknork's blue eye flares open and releases a beam of icy energy in a line that is 120-feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) cold damage and is restrained for 1 minute as its limbs freeze. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the restrained creature can be freed if it takes at least 10 fire damage.
