- **Sacred Flame (Cantrip; V, S):** One creature the priest can see within 60 feet makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 9 (2d8) radiant damage on a failure. This spell ignores cover.
- **Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):** The priest or a creature they touch is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the invisible creature attacks or casts a spell.
- **Spirit Guardians (3rd-Level; V, S, M, Concentration):** Spectral forms surround the priest in a 10-foot radius for 10 minutes. The priest can choose creatures they can see to be unaffected by the spell. Other creatures treat the area as difficult terrain  and when a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there  it makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw  taking 10 (3d6) radiant or necrotic damage (priests choice) on a failure or half damage on a success.

### Bonus Actions
