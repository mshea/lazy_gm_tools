### Special Abilities

- **Duelist's Mobility:** Opportunity attacks made against the duelist have disadvantage. If the duelist is prone at the start of its turn, it can immediately stand without costing movement.
- **Fey Ancestry:** The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shadow fey duelist makes two Rapier attacks and one Dagger attack.
- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Rapier:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Traveler (3/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** The shadow fey duelist adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the duelist must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
