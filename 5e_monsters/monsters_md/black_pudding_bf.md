### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Corrosive Form:** A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can eat through a panel of nonmagical wood or metal in its space that is up to 2 inches thick in 1 round.
- **Ooze Nature:** The pudding doesn't require sleep.
- **Ooze Resilience:** The pudding is resistant to the restrained condition, and it is immune to exhaustion and to the blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, and prone conditions.
- **Spider Climb:** The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Dampen Light:** The black pudding dims the light around it. The radius of each light source within 60 feet of it is halved until the start of its next turn. The pudding can't use this action while in sunlight.
