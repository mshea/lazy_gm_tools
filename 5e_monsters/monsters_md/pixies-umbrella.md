### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the pixie's umbrella remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary fungus.

### Actions

- **Twirl:** The pixie's umbrella twirls, spinning its spores at nearby creatures. Each creature within 5 feet of the pixie's umbrella must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also poisoned until the end of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Float:** When a pixie's umbrella senses motion within 30 feet of it, it fills its cap with air and flies 20 feet away from the motion without provoking opportunity attacks.
