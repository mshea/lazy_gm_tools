### Special Abilities

- **Implant Egg:** If the horakh reduces a creature to 0 hp with a Bite attack or as a bonus action while within 5 feet of a creature with 0 hp, the horakh can implant an egg in the creature. The implanted egg rests in the creature's eye socket for 14 days while it incubates. A host creature can carry only one horakh egg to term at a time. While the egg is implanted, the host can't use its eye and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Exactly 24 hours before the egg hatches, the host becomes blinded. When the egg hatches, the young horakh erupts from the host's head, killing the host in the process.
- **Standing Leap:** The horakh's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The horakh makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the horakh scores a critical hit, it removes one of the target's eyes, provided the target has eyes, and places the eye in a fluid sac on its thorax. While missing half or less of its total number of eyes, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. While missing more than half its total number of eyes, the target is blinded until its sight is restored.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Stealth:** While in dim light or darkness, the horakh takes the Hide action.
