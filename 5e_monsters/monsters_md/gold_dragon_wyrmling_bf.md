- **Weakening Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales weakening gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 STR save or have disadvantage on STR-based attack rolls, STR checks, and STR saves for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
