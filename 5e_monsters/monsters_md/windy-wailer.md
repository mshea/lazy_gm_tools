### Special Abilities

- **Ghostlight:** When a creature that can see the windy wailer starts its turn within 30 feet of the wailer, the wailer can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the wailer isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failure, a creature is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 as it is mesmerized by the windy wailer.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the windy wailer until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the windy wailer in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The windy wailer can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

### Actions

- **Chilling Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) necrotic damage plus 7 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Wind Blast:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the windy wailer and knocked prone.
- **Frightful Gale (Recharge 5-6):** The windy wailer unleashes freezing wind filled with fearful wailing in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) cold damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>A creature reduced to 0 hp by the windy wailer's Frightful Gale and later revived is permanently marked by a shock of white hair somewhere on its body.
