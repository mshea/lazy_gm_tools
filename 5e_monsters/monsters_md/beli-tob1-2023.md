### Special Abilities

- **Arctic Hunter:** The beli has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain. In addition, it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight in snowy terrain.
- **Cold Regeneration:** If it starts its turn in an area with below freezing temperature, the beli regains 3 hp. If the beli takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the beli's next turn. The beli dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and it doesn't regenerate.
- **Flyby:** The beli doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

### Actions

- **Ice Dagger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage.
- **Icy Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion from the arrow's icy chill. On a success, the target can't suffer further levels of exhaustion from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours. If a creature would suffer a sixth level of exhaustion from this attack, it is reduced to 0 hp instead and must make death saving throws as normal. A creature reduced to 0 hp in this way can't suffer further levels of exhaustion from any beli's Icy Shortbow for 24 hours.
- **Invisibility:** The beli magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the beli wears or carries is invisible with it.
