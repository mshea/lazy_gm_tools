### Special Abilities

- **Binding Witness:** Creatures that make a pact or agree to terms while the drake witnesses the agreement are bound by the drake's magic. They have disadvantage on saving throws against scrying by the drake (simply making a successful save against the drake's scrying usually is enough to arouse its suspicion), and they become potential targets for the drake's Punish Transgressor action.
- **Sense Falsehood:** The drake knows if it hears a lie.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** A pact drake's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can cast the following spells, requiring only somatic components:
At will: detect magic
3/day each: arcane eye, clairvoyance, scrying

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The pact drake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claw.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Enforced Diplomacy (Recharge 5-6):** The pact drake breathes a calming haze in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. While charmed, a creature also can't attack up to five creatures of the pact drake's choice. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.
- **Punish Transgressor:** The drake targets a single creature within 60 feet that broke the terms of a pact witnessed by the drake. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1d6 minutes. The conditions can be ended early only with a dispel magic (DC 15) spell or similar magic. When these conditions end, the affected creature has disadvantage on saving throws until it finishes a long rest.
