### Special Abilities
- **Shapechange:** The angel can change between winged celestial form, its original mortal form, and that of a Medium-sized eagle. Its statistics are the same in each form, with the exception of its attacks in eagle form.
- **Ever Touching:** Fidele angels maintain awareness of their mate's disposition and health. Damage taken by one is split evenly between both, with the original target of the attack taking the extra point when damage doesn't divide evenly. Any other baneful effect, such as ability damage, affects both equally.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the angel's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: guidance, light, purify food and drink, spare the dying  3/day: cure wounds, scorching ray (5 rays)  1/day: bless, daylight, detect evil and good, enhance ability, hallow, protection from evil and good
- **Magic Resistance:** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The angel's weapon attacks are magical while it is in eagle form.
- **To My Lover's Side:** If separated from its mate, each fidele angel can use both plane shift and teleport 1/day to reunite.
- **Unshakeable Fidelity:** Fidele angels are never voluntarily without their partners. No magical effect or power can cause a fidele angel to act against its mate, and no charm or domination effect can cause them to leave their side or to change their feelings of love and loyalty toward each other.
