### Special Abilities

- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d6 + 9) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Warped Energy Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon blasts warped arcane energy in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 90 (20d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
- **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a tail attack.
- **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
