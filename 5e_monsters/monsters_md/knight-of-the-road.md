### Special Abilities

- **Fey Ancestry:** The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.
- **Keen Sight:** The shadow fey has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Obscure the Way (1/Day):** As a bonus action, the shadow fey designates a creature it can see within 100 feet and obscures the creature and its companions' travel on a particular shadow road. That shadow road will not open for the designated creature or its traveling companions except through powerful magical means such as by a key of Veles. In addition, that shadow road won't lead to its usual destination for the designated creature or its traveling companions, instead leading the group in a meandering loop. This effect lasts for 9 (2d8) days, until the shadow fey removes the effect, or until the shadow fey dies.
- **Shadow Traveler (3/Day):** As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Traveler in Darkness:** The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.
