### Special Abilities

- **Bound in Jelly:** The mydnari and its jelly are wholly reliant on each other. If the mydnari's jelly is somehow separated from its master, the jelly dies within 1 minute. If the mydnari is separated from its jelly, it loses its blindsight, Acid Glob action, and Jelly Symbiosis trait.
- **Jelly Symbiosis:** A creature that touches the mydnari or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage.
- **Ooze Empathy:** A mydnari can use its Animal Handling skill on ooze-type creatures with an Intelligence score of 5 or lower. An ooze never attacks a mydnari unless provoked.

### Actions

- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Acid Glob:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) acid damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
