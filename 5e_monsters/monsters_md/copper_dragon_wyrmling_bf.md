### Special Abilities

- **Pounce:** If the dragon moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 STR save or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the dragon can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d10+2) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6+2) slashing damage.
- **Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11 DEX save, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Slowing Breath (Recharge 6):** The dragon exhales slowing gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 CON save. On a failure, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
