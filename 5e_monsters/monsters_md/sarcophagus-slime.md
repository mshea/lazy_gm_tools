### Special Abilities
- **Amorphous:** The sarcophagus slime can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The sarcophagus slime uses its Frightful Presence, uses its Corrupting Gaze, and makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) acid damage.
- **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime's choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- **Corrupting Gaze:** The sarcophagus slime targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the sarcophagus slime, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. If this effect reduces a creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies and its corpse becomes a sarcophagus slime within 24 hours. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until it is affected by greater restoration or comparable magic.
