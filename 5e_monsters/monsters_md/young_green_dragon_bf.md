### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Hallucinogenic Gas:** After the green dragon exhales its Poison Breath, wisps of poisonous gas laced with the alchemical taint that permeates the dragon's body linger around it. While the dragon's Poison Breath is unavailable, each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 14 WIS save or be terrified, as the gas causes the creature to experience frightful hallucinations. A terrified creature is frightened, and its speed is reduced to 0.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d10+4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6+4) slashing damage.
- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 CON save, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
