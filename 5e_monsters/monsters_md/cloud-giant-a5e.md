### Special Abilities

- **Cloud Sight:** Clouds and fog do not impair the giants vision.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The giants spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant attacks twice with its glaive.
- **Glaive:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is pushed up to 10 feet away from the giant and knocked prone.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 39 (9d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 20 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Fog Cloud (1st-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The giant creates a 20-foot-radius  heavily obscured sphere of fog centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour). It lasts for 1 hour.

### Bonus Actions

- **Gust:** One creature within 10 feet makes a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed up to 30 feet away from the giant.
- **Misty Step (2nd-Level; V):** The giant teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The giant can't cast this spell and a 1st-level or higher spell on the same turn.
