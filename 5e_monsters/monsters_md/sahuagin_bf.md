### Special Abilities

- **Blood Frenzy:** The sahuagin has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its HP.
- **Limited Amphibiousness:** The sahuagin can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.
- **Shark Telepathy:** The sahuagin can magically command any shark within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sahuagin makes one Bite attack and one Claws or Trident attack.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (2d4) slashing damage.
- **Trident:** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 3 (1d6) piercing damage, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the target is wielding a weapon or shield, it must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or drop the weapon or shield (the sahuagin's choice if the target is wielding both).

### Reactions

- **Circling Sharks:** If the sahuagin ends its turn within 10 feet of at least two other friendly sahuagin or sharks, the sahuagin can snap its teeth at one creature within 15 feet of it that it can see and that can see or hear it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
