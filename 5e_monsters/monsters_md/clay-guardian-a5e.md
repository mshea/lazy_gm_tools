- **Berserk:** When the guardian starts its turn while bloodied , roll a d6. On a 6, the guardian goes berserk. While berserk, the guardian attacks the nearest creature it can see. If it can’t reach a creature, it attacks an object. The guardian stays berserk until it is destroyed or restored to full hit points.

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature  it makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage dealt. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A greater restoration spell or similar magic removes the reduction.
