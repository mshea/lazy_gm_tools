### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The sandwyrm makes one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and one Stinger attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

### Reactions

- **Spine Trap:** When the sandwyrm is burrowed just below the surface of sand with its back spines exposed and a Medium or smaller creature enters the spines' space, the sandwyrm closes the spines on the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. When the sandwyrm moves, a restrained creature moves with it. The sandwyrm can have only one creature restrained at a time. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.
