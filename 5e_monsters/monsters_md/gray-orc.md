### Special Abilities

- **Silent Hunters:** Adept at surviving in a dark and quiet world below the ground, gray orcs instinctively know how to move, hunt, and kill without making the slightest sound. When they hunt, gray orcs paint their pale skin with swirls of a mushroom-based black resin. They often form the resin into runes or symbols of their gods as a way of honoring the gods and asking for success on the hunt.
- **Aggressive:** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
- **Magic Absorption:** When the gray orc is hit by a spell or is in the area of a spell, it regains hp equal to the spell's level. This trait doesn't counter the spell or negate its damage or effects. The orc regains the hp after the spell is resolved.
- **Pack Tactics:** The gray orc has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the orc's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the gray orc has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
