### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The scroll mummy has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Scroll Body:** The scroll mummy can inscribe a spell from a spellbook or scroll onto the parchment wrappings that cover its body as if copying a spell into a spellbook. Alternatively, it can inscribe a spell another spellcaster knows or has prepared onto its body by striking the spellcaster with its Spell-Siphoning Fist (see below). If the scroll mummy inscribes a spell with its Spell-Siphoning Fist, the inscription is free and happens immediately. The scroll mummy can use any spell it has inscribed onto its body once per day.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The scroll mummy's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:
At will: comprehend languages, fire bolt, mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of sickness
5/day each: hold person, inflict wounds, scorching ray
3/day each: bestow curse, fear
1/day each: black tentacles, confusion

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The scroll mummy makes two spell-siphoning fist attacks.
- **Spell-Siphoning Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (2d10) force damage. If the target is a spellcaster, it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or lose one random unused spell slot. The scroll mummy inscribes one of the spellcaster's spells of that slot level onto the parchment wrappings that cover its body (see the Scroll Body trait).
