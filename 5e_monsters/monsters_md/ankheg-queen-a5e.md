### Actions

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends  the target is restrained  and the ankheg can't use its claws on anyone else.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the ankheg. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) slashing damage. If this damage kills the target  the ankheg severs its head.
- **Acid Spray (Recharge 6):** The ankheg spits a 30-foot-long  5-foot-wide stream of acid. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 14 (4d6) acid damage on a failure or half damage on a success. If the ankheg is grappling a target  it instead bathes the target in acid  dealing 14 (4d6) acid damage with no saving throw only to that target.
