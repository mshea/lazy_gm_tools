### Special Abilities

- **Viscid Shell:** When a creature hits the bearmit crab with a slashing or piercing melee weapon, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw, or its weapon becomes stuck to the bearmit crab's shell. While the weapon is stuck, it can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength check and succeeding.
- **Keen Smell:** The bearmit crab has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **False Appearance:** While the bearmit crab remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pile of rocks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bearmit crab makes two attacks: one claw attack and one bite attack or two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The bearmit crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
