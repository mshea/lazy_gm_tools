### Special Abilities

- **Distract:** As a bonus action, the vanara can use its tail to distract an opponent within 5 feet of it by pulling on an arm, tossing dirt in the target's face, or some other method of interfering. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or have disadvantage on all attacks against the vanara until the vanara's next turn.
- **Quadrupedal Dash:** As a bonus action, the vanara can move up to 80 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. It can't use this trait if it is wielding a weapon or holding an object weighing more than 10 lbs.
- **Standing Leap:** The vanara's long jump is 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or drop its weapon in a space within 10 feet of the target.
- **Sling:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Howl (Recharge 5-6):** The vanara releases a sonorous howl in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened.
