### Special Abilities

- **Nauseating Stench:** A creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the qwyllion must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature that fails this saving throw is also incapacitated while poisoned in this way. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the qwyllion's Nauseating Stench for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The qwyllion makes three Claw or Deadly Gaze attacks. If two Deadly Gaze attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Deadly Gaze:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) psychic damage. A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 8 hours later as a specter under the qwyllion's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life. The qwyllion can have no more than ten specters under its control at one time.
- **Charm:** One Humanoid or Beast the qwyllion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the qwyllion's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the qwyllion's Charm for the next 24 hours.
