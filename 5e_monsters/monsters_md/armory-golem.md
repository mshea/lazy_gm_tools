### Special Abilities

- **Armory Exploit:** The objects that make up the golem's body can be removed or destroyed. With the exception of the slam attack, an attacker can choose to disable one of the armory golem's attacks on a critical hit. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to destroy the golem's focus instead of disabling one of its attacks.
- **Focus Weakness:** A creature grappling the armory golem can take its action to remove the golem's focus by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. If its focus is removed or destroyed, the armory golem must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a success, the golem continues working properly, but it repeats the saving throw the next round at 1 higher DC. On a failure, the golem dies, falling into a heap of armaments.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The armory golem makes any two weapon attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Polearm Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Crossbow Barrage:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Shield Wall (Recharge 4-6):** The golem reconfigures its construction, moving shields and armor to encase its body. It regains 10 hp, and its AC increases by 2 until the end of its next turn.
