### Special Abilities

- **Alchemical Arrows:** As a bonus action, the archer attaches an alchemy tube to the shaft of one arrow before firing its longbow. On a successful hit, the alchemy tube shatters and does one of the following:
Concussive. The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) thunder damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
Entangling. The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) acid damage and is restrained by sticky, alchemical goo. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 16 Strength check, bursting through the goo on a success. The goo can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; immunity to piercing, slashing, poison, and psychic damage).
Explosive. The target takes an extra 18 (4d8) fire damage and catches on fire, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 16 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
- **Fey Ancestry:** The archer has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the archer to sleep.
- **Hunter's Aim:** Once per turn, when the archer makes a ranged attack with its longbow and hits, the target takes an extra 28 (8d6) damage.
