### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The oasis keeper can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
- **Oasis Camouflage:** The oasis keeper has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while in a desert or in sandy terrain beneath water.
- **Pacifying Secretions:** If the oasis keeper's stinger sits in water for at least 1 hour, the water becomes poisoned with its toxin. A creature that drinks the poisoned water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be calmed for 24 hours. A calmed creature feels compelled to stay at the oasis and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice or recognize danger. A calmed creature that drinks the water again before 24 hours have passed has disadvantage on the saving throw. The greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the calming effect early.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The oasis keeper makes two attacks: one with its stinger and one with its bite
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft, one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
