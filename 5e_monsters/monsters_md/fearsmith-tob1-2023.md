### Special Abilities

- **Distortion Gaze:** Those who meet the gaze of the fear smith experience the world seeming to twist at unnatural angles beneath their feet. When a creature that can see the fear smith's eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the fear smith can force the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw if the fear smith isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is disoriented until the start of its next turn. While disoriented, a creature can't take the Dash or Disengage action, and when it moves for the first time on its turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
- **Hidden Eye:** The fear smith has advantage on saving throws against being blinded.
- **Magic Resistance:** The fear smith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
