### Special Abilities

- **Lightning Absorption:** Whenever the thrummren is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the lightning damage dealt.
- **Magic Resistance:** The thrummren has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The thrummren's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Storm Hide:** A creature that touches the thrummren or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. The thrummren can choose for its rider to not be affected by this trait.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The thrummren makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its hooves.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.
- **Hooves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) thunder damage.
- **Thunder Stomp (Recharge 5-6):** The thrummren rears back and slams its front hooves into the ground. Each creature within 20 feet of the thrummren must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) thunder damage, is pushed up to 10 feet away from the thrummren, and is deafened until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't pushed or deafened.

### Reactions

- **Protect Rider:** When the thrummren's rider is the target of an attack the thrummren can see, the thrummren can choose to become the target of the attack instead.
