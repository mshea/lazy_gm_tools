### Special Abilities
- **Innate Spellcasting:** the leshy's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  at will: animal friendship, pass without trace, speak with animals  1/day each: entangle, plant growth, shillelagh, speak with plants, hideous laughter
- **Camouflage:** A leshy has advantage on Stealth checks if it is at least lightly obscured by foliage.
- **Mimicry:** A leshy can mimic the calls and voices of any creature it has heard. To use this ability, the leshy makes a Charisma (Deception) check. Listeners who succeed on an opposed Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Nature)-DM's choice-realize that something is mimicking the sound. The leshy has advantage on the check if it's mimicking a general type of creature (a crow's call, a bear's roar) and not a specific individual's voice.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The leshy makes two club attacks.
- **Change Size:** The leshy appears to change its size, becoming as tall as a massive oak (Gargantuan) or as short as a blade of grass (Tiny). The change is entirely illusory, so the leshy's statistics do not change.
- **Club:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
