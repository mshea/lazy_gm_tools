### Special Abilities

- **Death Burst:** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a cloud of steam. Each creature within 5 feet of the mephit must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be scalded for 1 minute. A scalded creature has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls and on ability checks that require manual dexterity. A scalded creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **False Appearance:** While the mephit remains motionless and hovering, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary cloud of steam.

### Actions

- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.
- **Steam Blast:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage
- **Steam Breath (Recharge 6):** The mephit exhales superheated breath in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 CON save. On a failure, a creature takes 5 (2d4) fire damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't suffer exhaustion. A creature can't suffer more than two levels of exhaustion from a steam mephit's Steam Breath, regardless of the number of times it fails the save or the number of steam mephits using Steam Breath against it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Hazy Form (1/Day):** The mephit casts the blur spell, requiring no material components and using WIS as the spellcasting ability.
