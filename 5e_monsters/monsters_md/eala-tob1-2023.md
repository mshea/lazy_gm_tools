### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The eala makes two Wing Blades attacks.
- **Wing Blades:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The eala breathes fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The eala's fire breath ignites flammable objects and melts soft metals, such as gold and lead, in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

### Reactions

- **Swan Song:** When the eala is reduced to 0 hp, it can use its last breath to sing a plaintive and beautiful melody. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear the eala must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. While incapacitated, the creature's speed is reduced to 0.
