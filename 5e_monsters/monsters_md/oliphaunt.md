### Special Abilities

- **Trampling Charge:** If the oliphaunt moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the oliphaunt can make one stomp attack against it as a bonus action.
- **Trunk Slam:** If the oliphaunt starts its turn with a target grappled, it can slam the target into the ground as a bonus action. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This doesn't end the grappled condition on the target.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The oliphaunt uses its trunk, then it makes one gore or stomp attack.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 30 (5d8 + 8) piercing damage.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (5d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
- **Trunk:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 17) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and the oliphaunt can't use its trunk on another target.
- **Tusk Sweep (Recharge 5-6):** The oliphaunt sweeps its tusks in a wide arc. Each creature in a 20-foot cube must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
