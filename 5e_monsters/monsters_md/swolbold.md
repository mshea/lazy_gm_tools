- **Leaping Attack:** If the swolbold uses the Dash action on its turn and stops within 5 feet of a creature, it can make one slam attack with disadvantage as a bonus action against that creature.
- **Pack Tactics:** The swolbold has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the swolbold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the swolbold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and the swolbold can't make slam attacks against other targets.
- **Crush:** One creature grappled by the swolbold must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw, taking 21 (5d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
