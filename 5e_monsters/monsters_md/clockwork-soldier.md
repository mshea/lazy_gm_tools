### Special Abilities

- **Immutable Form:** The soldier is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Intimidating Legions:** A single clockwork soldier's rigid movements appear silly, but, when gathered in numbers, they become an inhuman terror. When the clockwork soldier makes a Charisma (Intimidation) check, it gains a bonus on that check equal to the number of other clockwork soldiers the target can see or hear.
- **Magic Resistance:** The soldier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Halberd:** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Overdrive Flurry (Recharge 6):** The soldier makes four halberd attacks. After taking this action, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.
