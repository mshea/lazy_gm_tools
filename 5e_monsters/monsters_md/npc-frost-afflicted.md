### Special Abilities

- **Burning Cold:** A creature with resistance to cold doesn't have resistance to the cold dealt by the frost-afflicted. A creature with immunity to cold is unaffected by this trait.
- **Icy Nature:** The frost-afflicted is infused with minor elemental power and it requires only half the amount of food and drink that a typical humanoid of its size needs.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Frigid Punch or Frost Bolt attacks.
- **Frigid Punch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 4 (1d4+2) bludgeoning damage and 5 (2d4) cold.
- **Frost Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, 60 ft., one target, 8 (2d4+3) cold.

### Reactions

- **Frigid Flare:** When a creature hits the frost-afflicted with weapon attack ice bursts from the frost-afflicted. Each creature within 5 ft. of the frost-afflicted must make a DC 13 Con save taking 5 (2d4) cold on a failed save or half damage if made.
