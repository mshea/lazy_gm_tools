### Special Abilities

- **Monstrosity Resilience:** The ankheg is resistant to exhaustion and to the frightened condition.

### Actions

- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 10 (2d6+3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can't Bite another target.
- **Acid Spray (Recharge 6):** The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 DEX save, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Save for Later:** The ankheg quickly digs a small hole and stuffs one creature grappled by it into the hole, burying the creature and ending the grapple. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 13 STR check.
