### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The gnarljak doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **False Appearance:** While the gnarljak remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal bear trap.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The gnarljak makes one Gnawing Bite attack and two Chain Tail attacks, or it makes three Chain Tail attacks.
- **Gnawing Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the gnarljak attaches to the target. While attached, the gnarljak can't make Gnawing Bite attacks, and at the start of each of the gnarljak's turns, the target takes 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.
- **Chain Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Secure Tail:** When within 10 feet of the ground, structure, wall, or other solid surface, the gnarljak can secure its tail spike on a point in the surface within 10 feet of it. While secured, the gnarljak can't be knocked prone, it can't move more than 10 feet from that point, and its Chain Tail attack's reach is reduced to 5 feet. If the gnarljak is attached to a creature while its tail is secured, the creature is restrained until the gnarljak is no longer attached to it.
