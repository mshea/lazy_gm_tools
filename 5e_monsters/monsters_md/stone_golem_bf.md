### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Golem Resilience:** The golem is immune to poison and psychic damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to exhaustion and to the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saves against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The golem makes three Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 21 (3d10+5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Slow (Recharge 6):** The golem shares the plodding perception of timeless stone with those nearby, slowing all life to a crawl. Each creature within 10 feet of the golem must make a DC 17 WIS save. On a failure, a creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Rearrange Stone:** The stone golem rearranges some of the stone comprising its body, choosing one of the following arrangements. The arrangement lasts until the golem ends the effect as a bonus action, uses this bonus action again, or until it is incapacitated.<br>- **Jagged Stones.** The golem turns several of the stones on its body to point outward. Its AC is reduced by 2, and each time a creature within 5 feet of the golem hits it with a melee attack, the attacker takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage.<br>- **Protective Slabs.** The golem slides several flat stones around its body to protect its vulnerable areas. Its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and each time it takes damage, the damage is reduced by 5 (2d4).
