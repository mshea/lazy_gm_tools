### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The mahoru can breathe air and water.
- **Blood Frenzy:** The mahoru has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all of its hp.
- **Keen Sight and Smell:** The mahoru has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.
- **Pack Tactics:** The mahoru has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the mahoru's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage. If the mahoru scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or the mahoru bites off one of the target's limbs. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage.
- **Roar:** The mahoru roars while above water or emits a loud, low thrum while underwater. Each creature within 30 feet of the mahoru that can hear the roar or thrum must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also paralyzed until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Roar of all mahoru for the next 24 hours.
