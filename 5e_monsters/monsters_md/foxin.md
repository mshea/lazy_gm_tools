### Special Abilities

- **Keen Senses:** The foxin has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, hearing, or smell.
- **Neutral Presence:** A foxin naturally emits an air of total belonging. It doesn't go unnoticed, but other creatures always behave as though the foxin's presence is normal and unobtrusive.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Illusory Calm:** The foxin targets any number of non-foxin creatures within 30 feet. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be treated as charmed against all enemies and dangers for 1 minute. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the foxin's Illusory Calm for the next 24 hours. A creature has advantage on the saving throw if it suffers any harm while charmed.
