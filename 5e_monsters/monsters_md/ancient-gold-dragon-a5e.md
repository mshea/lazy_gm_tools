- **Valor:** Creatures of the dragons choice within 30 feet gain a +3 bonus to saving throws and are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 25). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components. 3/day each:bless, healing word,banishment, greater restoration,  1/day:divine word, hallow

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks with its bite and twice with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage  and the dragon pushes the target 10 feet away.
- **Greatsword (Humanoid Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.
- **Molten Spit:** The dragon targets one creature within 60 feet  forcing it to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 27 (5d10) fire damage on a failure or half on a success. Liquid gold pools in a 5-foot-square occupied by the creature and remains hot for 1 minute. A creature that ends its turn in the gold or enters it for the first time on a turn takes 22 (4d10) fire damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:
- **Molten Breath:** The dragon exhales molten gold in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw  taking 88 (16d10) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw is covered in a shell of rapidly cooling gold  reducing its Speed to 0. A creature can use an action to break the shell  ending the effect.
- **Weakening Breath:** The dragon exhales weakening gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on weapon attack rolls for 1 minute. A weakened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on a success.
- **Change Shape:** The dragon magically takes the shape of a humanoid or beast  or changes back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (dragons choice). In the new form  the dragons stats are unchanged except for its size. It can't use Molten Spit  Breath Weapons  Tail Attack  or Wing Attack except in dragon form. In beast form  it can attack only with its bite and claws  if appropriate to its form. If the beast form is Large or smaller  the reach of these attacks is reduced to 5 feet. In humanoid form  it can attack only with its greatsword.

### Reactions

- **Tail Attack:** When a creature the dragon can see within 10 feet hits the dragon with a melee attack, the dragon makes a tail attack against it.
- **Vanguard:** When another creature the dragon can see within 20 feet is hit by an attack, the dragon deflects the attack, turning the hit into a miss.



### Legendary Actions

- **The dragon can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. It regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Roar:** Each creature of the dragons choice within 120 feet that can hear it makes a DC 25 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it is frightened for 1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. When it succeeds on a saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to Roar for 24 hours.
- **Wing Attack:** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet makes a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its fly speed.
- **Fiery Reprisal (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon uses Molten Spit against the last creature to deal damage to it.
