### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The zalikum doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Ghastly Heated Body:** A creature that touches the zalikum or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Rejuvenation:** The zalikum can store the souls of up to 3 victims inside it at one time. If it has at least 1 soul, a destroyed zalikum gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of its sandy remains. If its sandy remains are soaked with holy water and buried in consecrated ground, its trapped souls are freed, and the zalikum can't rejuvenate.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The zalikum makes one beak attack and one talon attack.
- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage. If a creature is slain by this attack, its body crumbles to sand, and the zalikum stores its soul. The creature can be restored to life only if the zalikum is destroyed and can't rejuvenate (see the Rejuvenation trait).
- **Talon:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage and 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Death-infused Desert Breath (Recharge 6):** The zalikum exhales superheated sand infused with the power of damned souls in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature's saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature also suffers one level of exhaustion.
