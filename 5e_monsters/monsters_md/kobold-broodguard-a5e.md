### Special Abilities

- **Pack Tactics:** The kobold has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the kobolds allies is within 5 feet of the creature and not incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Perception checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kobold makes a bill hook attack and a spiked shield attack.
- **Bill Hook:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage  and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 12 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Spiked Shield:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Sling:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

### Reactions

- **Rally! (1/Day:** When the kobold takes damage, it shouts a rallying cry. All kobolds within 30 feet that can hear it gain immunity to the frightened condition for 1 minute, and their next attack roll made before this effect ends deals an extra 1d4 damage.
