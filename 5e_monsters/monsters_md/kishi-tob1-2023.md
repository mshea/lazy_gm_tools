### Special Abilities

- **Fiendish Weapons:** The kishi's weapon attacks are magical. When the kishi hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d8 cold damage (included in the attack).
- **Two Heads:** The kishi has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.
- **Magic Resistance:** The kishi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kishi makes one Bite attack and two Spear attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Spellcasting:** The kishi casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):<br>At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, suggestion<br>3/day: glibness<br>1/day: dominate person

### Bonus Actions

- **Trophy Shield:** The kishi absorbs some of the essence of a creature it killed since the end of its previous turn and magically creates a grisly trophy of the creature on its shield or spear. For 1 hour, its Armor Class becomes 20, and creatures of the same type as the slain creature have disadvantage on attack rolls against the kishi.
- **Summon Demon (1/Day):** The kishi demon magically calls 1d4 giant hyenas that are Fiends with the kishi's damage resistances and immunities. It has a 50 percent chance of calling one kishi demon instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the kishi and obeying its telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the kishi dies, or until the kishi dismisses them as a bonus action.
