### Special Abilities

- **Leech Luck:** If a creature within 60 feet of the luck leech rolls a 20 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the luck leech gains 1 luck point. It can't have more than 4 luck points at a time.
- **Reserve of Fortune:** If the luck leech doesn't have 4 luck points at sunset, it gains 2 luck points. It can't have more than 4 luck points at a time. In addition, if the luck leech rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw while it has at least 1 luck point, it can reroll the die and must use the new roll. This trait doesn't expend luck points.
- **Turn Luck:** As a bonus action, the luck leech can spend 1 luck point to: 
* Gain advantage on its next attack or saving throw 
* Cast misty step
* Increase the necrotic damage of its next successful biting arms attack by an extra 9 (2d8) 
* Force each creature that is concentrating on a spell within 60 feet of it to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, losing its concentration on the spell on a failure.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The luck leech makes two biting arm attacks.
- **Biting Arms:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Feast of Fortune (Recharge 6):** Each creature the luck leech can see within 30 feet of it must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 27 (6d8) psychic damage, becomes blinded until the end of its next turn, and is cursed with falling fortunes. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded or cursed. For each creature that fails this saving throw, the luck leech gains 1 luck point.
