### Special Abilities

- **Crossbow Expert:** The master assassin ignores the loading quality of light crossbows, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnt impose disadvantage on the master assassins ranged attack rolls.
- **Deadly Poison:** As part of making an attack, the master assassin can apply a deadly poison to their weapons (included below). The master assassin carries 3 doses of this poison. A single dose can coat two melee weapons or up to 10 pieces of ammunition.
- **Death Strike (1/Turn):** When the master assassin scores a critical hit against a living creature that is surprised, that creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature dies if it fails two death saves before it stabilizes.
- **Epic Assassinate:** During the first turn of combat, the master assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasnt acted. Any hit the master assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit, and every creature that can see the master assassins attack is rattled until the end of the master assassins next turn.
- **Evasion:** When the master assassin makes a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The master assassin deals an extra 28 (8d6) damage when they hit with a weapon attack while they have advantage on the attack, or when the master assassins target is within 5 feet of an ally of the master assassin while the master assassin doesnt have disadvantage on the attack.
