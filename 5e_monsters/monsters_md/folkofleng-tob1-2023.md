### Special Abilities

- **Ethereal Sight:** The folk of Leng can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
- **Leng Rejuvenation:** If the folk of Leng dies on the Material Plane, it gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again, unless it is killed with radiant damage wielded by a good-aligned creature or its remains are sprinkled with holy water within 24 hours of its death. The folk's new body appears in its family's crypt in Leng.
- **Mortal Void Traveler:** The folk of Leng doesn't require air or ambient pressure.
- **Phrenic Weapons:** The folk of Leng's weapon attacks are magical. When the folk hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 psychic damage (included in the attack).
- **Regeneration:** The folk of Leng regains 2 hp at the start of its turn. If the folk of Leng takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the folk's next turn. The folk of Leng dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.

### Actions

- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage.
- **Psychic Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage.
- **Hooked Spider Net:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the target is restrained. While restrained, the target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature, including the restrained target, can take an action to remove the net by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the creature breaks the net instead, and the folk of Leng can't use the broken net again until it finishes a long rest.
- **Spellcasting:** The folk of Leng casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):<br>At will: message, minor illusion<br>3/day each: disguise self, suggestion

### Bonus Actions

- **Etherealness:** The folk of Leng enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
