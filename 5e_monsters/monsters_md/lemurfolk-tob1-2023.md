### Special Abilities

- **Glide:** The lemurfolk has membranes between its fore and hind limbs that expand when falling to slow its rate of descent to 60 feet per round, landing on its feet and taking no falling damage. It can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it falls. The lemurfolk can't gain height with its gliding membranes alone. If subjected to a strong wind or lift of any kind, it can use the updraft to glide farther.

### Actions

- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
- **Blowgun:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 25/100 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
