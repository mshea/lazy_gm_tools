### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** Move through space 1ft.+ wide with o squeezing.
- **Hollow Cylindrical Form (Stretched Body Only):** Creatures can occupy space in center of cylinder formed by the ooze and each such space is always within ooze's reach regardless of cylinder's size.
- **Ooze Nature:** The sinkhole ooze doesn't require sleep.
- **Seizing Pseudopods:** Can have up to 6 tendril-like Pseudopods at a time. Each can be attacked (AC 10; 10 hp; immunity to acid poison and psychic). Destroying Pseudopod deals no damage to ooze which can extrude a replacement on its next turn. Pseudopod can also be broken if creature takes an action and makes DC 14 Str check.
- **Slimy Appearance (Stretched Body Only):** While it remains motionless is indistinguishable from interior of the pit or hole in the ground it is stretched across though interior walls appear wet.
- **Spider Climb:** Difficult surfaces even ceilings no ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 15 ft., one creature,. 9 (1d10+4) bludgeoning damage + 3 (1d6) acid and target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends target is restrained and takes 3 (1d6) acid at start of each of its turns and ooze can't use same Pseudopod on another target.

### Bonus Actions

- **Stretch Body:** Stretches body around inner walls of a pit sinkhole or other circular opening in the ground. Stretched this way it forms a hollow cylinder up to 25 ft. tall up to 25 ft. radius. Ooze can end stretch as a bonus action occupying nearest unoccupied space to the hole.

### Reactions

- **Pluck (Stretched Body Only):** When 1+ creature falls down center of its cylinder can try to grab up to 2 of them. Each must make DC 14 Dex save or grappled (escape DC 14) in Pseudopod.
