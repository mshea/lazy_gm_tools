### Special Abilities

- **Innate Spellcasting:** The djinnis innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: alter self (can assume Medium or Large form), detect magic, wind wall, 3/day each: creation, major image, tongues, wind walk, 1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), control weather, create food and water (10 supply), plane shift (to Elemental Plane of Air only)

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.
- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.
- **Lightning Blast:** Ranged Spell Attack: +9 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. Hit: 35 (10d6) lightning damage.
- **Scimitar Sweep (1/Day, Giant Form Only):** The djinn makes a scimitar attack against each creature of its choice within its reach.

### Bonus Actions

- **Giant Form (1/Day:** The djinni magically becomes a Huge, semi-substantial creature of billowing cloud. In this form, it gains resistance to nonmagical damage, and its scimitar attacks gain a reach of 10 feet. The effect ends after 1 minute, when the djinni is incapacitated, or if the djinn becomes bloodied.
- **Whirlwind (1/Day):** A magical, 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-tall whirlwind appears in a space the djinni can see within 60 feet. The whirlwind may appear in another creatures space. If the whirlwind appears in another creatures space, or when it enters a creatures space for the first time on a turn, the creature makes a DC 18 Strength check, becoming restrained by the whirlwind on a failure. The whirlwind may restrain one creature at a time. A creature within 5 feet of the whirlwind (including the restrained creature) can use an action to make a DC 18 Strength check, freeing the restrained creature on a success. A freed creature can move to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the whirlwind.
- **As a bonus action:** The whirlwind disappears if the djinni loses sight of it, if the djinni dies or is incapacitated, or if the djinni dismisses it as an action.
