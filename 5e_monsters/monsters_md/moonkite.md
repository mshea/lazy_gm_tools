### Special Abilities

- **Celestial Freedom:** The moonkite ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled. In addition, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would banish it from its current plane or that would bind it to a particular location or creature. The moonkite can grant this trait to anyone riding it.
- **Flyby:** The moonkite doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Magic Resistance:** The moonkite has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The moonkite's weapon attacks are magical and silvered.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The moonkite makes four wing buffet attacks. Alternatively, it can use Radiant Arrow twice.
- **Radiant Arrow:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (4d6) radiant damage.
- **Wing Buffet:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the moonkite scores a critical hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Planar Traveler:** The moonkite can transport itself to a different plane of existence. This works like the plane shift spell, except the moonkite can affect only itself and a willing rider, and can't banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
