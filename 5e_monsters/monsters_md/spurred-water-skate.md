### Special Abilities

- **Water Walker:** The spurred water skate can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless, solid ground. This trait works like the water walk spell.

### Actions

- **Stabbing Forelimbs:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 12) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the skate doesn't have two other creatures grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is in a liquid, the skate can hold it under the surface, and the target risks suffocating.
