### Special Abilities

- **Eldritch Sight:** Magical darkness doesn't impede the shantak's darkvision.
- **Flyby:** The shantak doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Keen Sight and Smell:** The shantak has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.
- **Magic Resistance:** The shantak has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Pack Tactics:** The shantak has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the shantak's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Unctuous Hide:** A shantak's hide is very slippery. A rider can dismount a shantak without any penalty to movement speed. If an effect moves the shantak against its will while a creature is on it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the shantak, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If a rider is knocked prone or unconscious while mounted, it must make the same saving throw. In addition, the shantak can attempt to shake off a rider as a bonus action, forcing the rider to make the saving throw to stay mounted.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The shantak makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its talons.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.
- **Talons:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.
- **Insane Tittering (Recharge 4-6):** The shantak emits a horrific screech. Each non-shantak creature within 60 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be frightened until the end of the shantak's next turn. The shantak can choose to include or exclude its rider when using this action.
