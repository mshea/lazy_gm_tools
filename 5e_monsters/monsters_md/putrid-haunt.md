- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Vomit Leeches (Recharge 6):** A putrid haunt can vomit forth the contents of its stomach onto a target within 5 feet. Along with the bile and mud from its stomach, this includes 2d6 undead leeches that attach to the target. A creature takes 1 necrotic damage per leech on it at the start of the creature's turn, and the putrid haunt gains the same number of temporary hit points. As an action, a creature can remove or destroy 1d3 leeches from itself or an adjacent ally.
