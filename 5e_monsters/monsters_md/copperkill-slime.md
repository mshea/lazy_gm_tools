### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** Move through space 1ft.+ wide with o squeezing.
- **Ooze Nature:** Doesn't require sleep.
- **Patinated Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from the object or structure it is stretched across though the object or structure appears to be covered in green paint or verdigris.
- **Spider Climb:** Difficult surfaces even ceilings no ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Pseudopods. If slime hits one creature with two Pseudopods target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends the target is restrained and takes 9 (2d8) poison at start of each of its turns. Slime can have only one target grappled in this way at a time.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (1d6+4) bludgeoning damage + 9 (2d8) poison.
- **Poisonous Snap (Stretched Body Only Recharge 5-6):** While it is covering an object or structure it can rapidly collapse back to its normal form ending the stretch and spraying all nearby creatures with poisonous slime. Each creature within 10 ft. of any space the stretched slime occupied before collapsing: 27 (6d8) poison and coated in poisonous slime (DC 15 Dex half not coated). A creature coated takes 9 (2d8) poison at start of each of its turns. A creature including slime-coated creature can take an action to clean it off.

### Bonus Actions

- **Stretch Body:** Stretches its body across surface of a Gargantuan or smaller object or across surface of a wall pillar or similar structure no larger than a 20' square within 5 ft. of it sharing the space of the object or structure. Slime can end the stretch as a bonus action occupying nearest unoccupied space to the object or structure.
