### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Slam attacks. Can replace one with Throttle.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 18 (4d6+4) bludgeoning damage. Target grappled (escape DC 15) if Med or smaller creature and it doesn't have two others grappled.
- **Shape Wood:** Alters shape of any one Med or smaller wooden object (or portion) up to 5 ft. in any dimension that it can see within 30' forming it into any shape it wants. Ex: warp boat planks so it takes on water seal wooden door to its frame (or make new door in wood wall) or twist wood weapon out of shape (or restore warped one). Warped thrown or ranged weapons and ammo are useless while warped melee weapons give disadvantage on attacks. Can't create items that usually require high craftsmanship ex: pulley. If target is worn/carried creature with it: DC 15 Dex save avoid effect on success.
- **Throttle:** One creature grappled by witchalder: 18 (4d6+4) bludgeoning damage and can't breathe speak or cast verbal spells until grapple ends (DC 15 Str half damage remains grappled but no other Throttle effects).
- **Pollen Cloud (Recharge 6):** Each creature within 15 ft. of witchalder: 22 (5d8) poison and incapacitated for 1 min (DC 15 Con half damage and isn't incapacitated). Incapacitated creature can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.
