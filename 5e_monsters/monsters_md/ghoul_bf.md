### Special Abilities

- **Hungry Dead Nature:** The ghoul doesn't require air or sleep. In addition, it must consume at least 2 pounds of raw meat every 24 hours, or it loses its immunity to exhaustion and risks starvation until it does so. While it has any levels of exhaustion from starvation, the ghoul can't remove levels of exhaustion until it consumes at least 4 pounds of raw meat.
- **Spider Climb:** The ghoul can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
- **Undead Resilience:** The ghoul is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the poisoned condition.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ghoul makes one Bite attack and one Claws attack. If both attacks hit a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or contract ghoul hunger (see the Ghoul Hunger sidebar).
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8+3) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 13 CON save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
