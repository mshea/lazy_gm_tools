- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage  and the target makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  the attack deals an extra 6 (1d12) piercing damage.

- **Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure  a creature is restrained as it begins to turn to stone. At the beginning of the gorgons next turn  the creature repeats the saving throw. On a success  the effect ends. On a failure  the creature is petrified. This petrification can be removed with greater restoration or similar magic.
