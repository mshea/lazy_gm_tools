### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The ravenfolk warrior can mimic animal sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Rune-Powered Weapons:** The ravenfolk's weapon attacks are magical. When the ravenfolk hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ravenfolk warrior makes one Peck attack and one Runespear attack, or it makes two Longbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Ghost Wings.
- **Peck:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage.
- **Runespear:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) radiant damage.
- **Ghost Wings:** The ravenfolk warrior furiously “beats” a set of phantasmal wings. Each creature within 5 feet of the ravenfolk must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.

### Reactions

- **Odin's Call (Recharge 6):** When the ravenfolk warrior takes damage while below half its hp maximum, it moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
