### Special Abilities

- **Gnome Cunning:** The deep gnome has advantage on INT, WIS, and CHA saves against magic.
- **Stone Camouflage:** The deep gnome's Stealth is 17 while in rocky terrain.

### Actions

- **War Pick:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8+2) piercing damage.
- **Crystalline Dart:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d4+2) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Infused Weapon:** The deep gnome crushes a magic-infused crystal on the end of its war pick. Until the start of the gnome's next turn the war pick is magical and deals an extra 2 (1d4) force damage when the gnome hits with it.
- **Discordant Shatter:** The deep gnome throws a magic-infused crystal at a point it can see within 30 feet of it, shattering the crystal, which emits a rapid series of discordant waves of magic. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 CON save or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn. A creature sensitive to or proficient in the use of magic, such as a spellcaster, has disadvantage on this save.

### Reactions

- **Crystalline Flash:** When a creature the deep gnome can see within 5 feet of it attacks it, it can throw a magic-infused crystal on the ground, shattering the crystal in a brilliant flash of light. If the attacker uses sight to perceive the gnome, the attacker must succeed on a DC 12 DEX save or have disadvantage on the attack roll.
