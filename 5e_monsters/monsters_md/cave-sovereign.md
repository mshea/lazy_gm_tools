Otherwise creature that fails is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until start of its next turn as it remains transfixed in place by the lights. Unless surprised creature can avert its eyes to avoid the save at start of its turn. If creature does so it can't see sovereign until start of its next turn when it can avert again. If creature looks at sovereign in the meantime it must immediately save.
