### Special Abilities

- **Gullible:** The giant makes Insight checks with disadvantage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant attacks twice with its greatclub.
- **Greatclub:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (6d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. In lieu of a rock  the giant can throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 30 feet. On a hit  the target and the thrown creature both take 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. On a miss  only the thrown creature takes the damage. The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.
- **Greatclub Sweep (1/Day, While Bloodied):** Each creature within 10 feet makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure  a creature takes 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage  is pushed 10 feet away from the giant  and falls prone.

### Bonus Actions

- **Grab:** One creature within 5 feet makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the giant can't grab another target, and it makes greatclub attacks with advantage against the grappled target.
