### Special Abilities

- **Energized Body:** A creature wearing metal or wielding a metal weapon that touches the spire walker or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage.

### Actions

- **Lightning Burst:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) lightning damage, and each creature, other than the target, within 10 feet of the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Invisibility:** The spire walker magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the spire walker wears or carries is invisible with it.

### Bonus Actions

- **Steeple Step:** The spire walker teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. The destination must be on the steeple of a building, mast of a ship, corner of a rooftop, or similar narrow point or feature.
