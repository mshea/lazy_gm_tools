### Special Abilities
- **Amphibious:** The lake troll can breathe air and water.
- **Keen Smell:** The lake troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Regeneration:** The lake troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the lake troll takes cold or fire damage, it regains only 5 hit points at the start of its next turn; if it takes both cold and fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the lake troll's next turn. The lake troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
### Actions
- **Multiattack:** The lake troll makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the lake troll hits a creature with both claw attacks in the same turn, the target creature must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or its weapon (if any) gains a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If the penalty reaches -5, the weapon is destroyed. A damaged weapon can be repaired with appropriate artisan's tools during a long rest.
