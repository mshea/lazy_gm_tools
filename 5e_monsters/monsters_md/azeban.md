### Special Abilities

- **Elusive:** The azeban can take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.
- **Magic Resistance:** The azeban has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The azeban's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: dancing lights, disguise self, faerie fire, minor illusion
3/day each: creation, major image, mislead, seeming
1/day each: mirage arcane, programmed illusion

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The azeban makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Ear-Splitting Yawp (Recharge 5-6):** The azeban emits a piercing yell in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage but isn't deafened. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the area.
