This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with _oil of slipperiness._ When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of _universal solvent_ or _oil of etherealness_, or with a _wish_ spell.
