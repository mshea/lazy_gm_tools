# Helm of Telepathy

- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** 5.1 SRD (D&D 2014)

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the _detect thoughts_ spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with _detect thoughts_, you can use an action to cast the _suggestion_ spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the _suggestion_ property can't be used again until the next dawn.
