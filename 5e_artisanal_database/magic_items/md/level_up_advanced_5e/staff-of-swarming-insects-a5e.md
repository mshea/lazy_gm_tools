# Staff of Swarming Insects

- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Type:** Staff
- **Attunement:** Yes
- **Source:** Level Up Advanced 5e

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend charges to conjure an insect cloud, or cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: _giant insect_  (4 charges), __insect plague_  (5 charges)

_**Insect Cloud**_ (1 Charge). A swarm of harmless flying insects spreads out in a 30-foot radius from you, _heavily obscuring_  the area for creatures other than you. It moves when you do, with you at its center. The radius of the swarm decreases by 10 feet each time you are included within an area of effect that deals damage. The insects remain for 10 minutes, until the swarm’s radius is less than 10 feet, or it is dispersed by strong wind.

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges each dawn. When the last charge is expended, roll a d20\. On a 1, the staff is destroyed as it transforms into a swarm of insects which immediately disperse.
