This stout, oaken cudgel helps you knock your opponents to the ground or away from you. When you hit a creature with this magic weapon, you can shove the target as part of the same attack, using your attack roll in place of a Strength (Athletics) check. The weapon deals damage as normal, regardless of the result of the shove. This property of the club can be used no more than once per hour.
