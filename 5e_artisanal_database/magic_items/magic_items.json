To place things into this space you must push it into the web, so it cannot hold liquids or gasses. You can only retrieve items you know are inside, making it excellent for smuggling. Retrieving items takes at least 2 actions (or more for larger objects) and things like loose coins tend to get lost inside it. No matter how full, the web never weighs more than a half pound.\n\nA creature attempting to divine the contents of the web via magic must first succeed on a DC 28 Arcana check which can only be attempted once between _long rests_ .\n\nAny creature placed into the extradimensional space is placed into stasis for up to a month, needing no food or water but still healing at a natural pace. Dead creatures in the web do not decay. If a living creature is not freed within a month, it is shunted from the web and appears beneath a large spider web 1d6 miles away in the real world.",

The broom\u2019s handle is said to have come from the first tree and the bristles stolen from a god, but its beginnings are far more humble\u2014just a simple mundane object that accrued its first enchantment by chance after years of exposure to countless rituals. Since then its attraction to magic has grown, and so too has its admiration for the arcane. The broom has been in the hands of countless spellcasters, many of them unlikely candidates to pursue magic, though it cannot remember their names.

It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The broom communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Common, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Sylvan, and Undercommon. \n\n_**Personality.**_ The broom\u2019s purpose is to encourage the use of magic\u2014the more powerful the better\u2014regardless of any consequences. It is unconcerned with the goings on of mortals or anyone not engaged with magic, and it demands a certain amount of respect and appreciation for its service.\n\n**_Demands._** If you are unable to cast spells and attune to the broom, it relentlessly argues for you to pursue magical training and if none is achieved within a month it goes dormant in your hands (becoming a very durable stick). In addition, the broom is a repository of magic over the ages and it strongly encourages you to seek out monsters to harvest powerful reagents, explore cursed ruins in search of forbidden knowledge, and undertake precarious rituals.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  made with the magic broom, and when the broom deals damage with a critical hit the target is _blinded_  until the end of your next turn.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Ancient Broom_, used by spellcasters since the dawn of time.\n\n**DC 18** The broom is able to animate itself and attack your enemies, it has the power to open locks and break shackles, and it enables you to move without leaving a trace of your passing.\n\n**DC 21** Many of those who have wielded the _Ancient Broom_ came from humble and unlikely backgrounds.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Ancient Broom_ has one lesser artifact detriment and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are attuned to the broom you gain an expertise die on checks made with Arcana, and while holding it you can innately cast __pass without trace_  (no _concentration_  required) and _nondetection_ at will.\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to knock the broom against a lock, door, lid, chains, shackles, or the like to open them. Once you have done so 3 times, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest. You can speak with the broom over the course of a _short rest_ , learning one ritual spell. The next time you use this feature, you forget the last spell learned from it.\n\n**Dancing Broom**\n\nIn addition, you can use a bonus action to toss this broom into the air and cackle. When you do so, the broom begins to hover, flies up to 60 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The broom uses your _attack roll_  and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and unless a target is hidden or _invisible_  it has _advantage_  on its attack roll.\n\n While the broom hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you.

      "desc": "The _Cane of Chaos_ (known by some by its fairytale name, the Little Silver Stick) is a gorgeous silver scepter etched with fractals, adorned with an eight-pointed star, and imbued with the power of chaos. A cunning historian may be able to track the cane\u2019s origins to a certain mage under a certain authoritarian regime centuries ago, who supplied it to a figure widely known for their role in the regime\u2019s downfall. Similarly, the cane seems to be drawn to those who march to their own drumbeat, directing them on behalf of its creator to sow disruption and turmoil.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Cane of Chaos_, used by a despot in times long past. It is also known as the Little Silver Stick.\n\n**DC 18** The cane stores and is able to cast spells linked to chaos, but randomly unleashes chaotic magical effects when used.\n\n**DC 21** The cane can only be destroyed by a sovereign on the day of their coronation.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Cane of Chaos_ has 1d4 lesser artifact benefits, 1d4 lesser artifact detriments, 1d4\u20131 greater artifact benefits, and 1d4+1 greater artifact detriments. \n\nIn addition, the cane has the finesse property and can be used as a double weapon which you become proficient with when you attune to it. You gain a +2 bonus to weapon attack rolls and damage rolls made using the _Cane of Chaos_.\n\n## **Magic**\n\nWhile you use this quarterstaff as a spell focus, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC. You know and have prepared all spells of the chaos school of magic (but not their rare versions). \n\nThe _Cane of Chaos_ begins with a number of charges equal to your proficiency bonus and regains 1d6 charges each dawn (to a maximum number of charges equal to your level + 1, or your CR + 1). You can expend any number of charges from the cane to cast a chaos spell, which costs a number of charges equal to the spell\u2019s level. Your spellcasting ability for these spells is your highest mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma).\n\nWhen you expend charges from the _Cane of Chaos_, it unleashes another chaotic magical effect, either chosen by the Narrator or randomly determined.\n\n__**Table: Cane of Chaos**__\n| **d8** | **Wild Magic Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1      | One random creature you see is subject to a _polymorph_  spell cast by the cane (using your spell save DC), turning it into a random CR 1/8 beast.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| 2      | The 1d6 doors nearest to you come under an _arcane lock_  effect as though cast by the creature nearest to you that can speak, write, or sign at least one language.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 3      | The cane creates a __control weather_  effect, driving the weather towards unseasonable extreme temperatures and conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| 4      | Each creature within 60 feet rolls 1d6, increasing a random ability score to 18 for the next 10 minutes (1: Strength, 2: Dexterity, 3: Constitution, 4: Intelligence, 5: Wisdom, 6: Charisma).                                                                                                                                                  |\n| 5      | Each creature within 60 feet is subject to a __levitation_ effect created by the cane (using your spell save DC).

      "desc": "Centuries ago, a famed artificer published her masterwork treatise on crafting magic items\u2014humbly titled _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_\u2014and the work was so revolutionary that every serious library simply had to have a copy. The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day. \n\n A regular copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles\u2014a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one\u2019s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.\n\n**DC 18** This book is a unique annotated version of the more common _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_.\n\n**DC 21** The Crafter\u2019s Codex can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.\n\nIn addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_, or keeping the book safely in your possession.\n\nOnce between _long rests_ , while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:\n\n* Reduce research time by 75%.\n* Reduce component cost by 75%.\n* Reduce crafting time by 75%.\n* Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.\n* Reduce a crafting DC by 6.\n\nAfter three failures on the Intelligence check, th_e Crafter\u2019s Codex_ moves on. You retain a copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ but the magic and marginalia of the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first). \n\n**Seekers of the Codex**\n\nThe _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the Crafter\u2019s Codex surely means encountering some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Codex**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                                                         |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Noble with entourage of bodyguards\u2014previous owner or antimagic zealot |\n| 2       | _Assassin_ , stealthy _mage_ , or _thief_                             |\n| 3       | Rival artificer (friendly or hostile)                                 |\n| 4       | Mischievous book-obsessed fey                                         |\n| 5       | Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar library               |\n| 6       | Rival artificer from an entirely different Material Plane             |\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter\u2019s Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ is to eliminate every last copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse\u2014if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the _Crafter\u2019s Codex_ persists.",

You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely.

This doesn\u2019t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.\n\nYou can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely. Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a _portable hole_ , in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4) random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is otherwise unaffected.\n\n_**Curse.**_ When you attune to this crown, your _Destiny_  immediately changes to _Dominion_  if it\u2019s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of _strife_  each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.\n\nThe crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.\n\n**_Escalation._** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast __scrying_  at will using the crown as a focus.",

The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1\u20133, or a full deck on a 4).\n\nBefore drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card's magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to fly out of the deck and take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nOnce you have drawn the number of cards that you\u2019ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4\\. On a 1\u20133 the deck vanishes, or on a 4 it returns to its coffer, allowing you to transport it should you so choose.\n\nThe Balance, Comet, Donjon, Fates, Fool, Gem, Idiot, Talons, and Vizier cards only appear in the 22 card deck.\n\n---\n\n\u2663 **Ace of Clubs: Talons.** Every magical item that you own is immediately destroyed.

While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. Even a _wish_ cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.\n\n\u2663 **Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.\n\n\u2663 **Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A merciless harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points.

      "desc": "When wizards go to war their desperation reveals the bleak depths and miraculous heights of magic. Long ago it was a desire to both bolster and renew their forces that led a mage to create a relic many would consider unthinkable: a scepter that twists the essence of life itself. With it the dead are remade into unrecognizable tangles of flesh that despite their deformity do the wielder of the scepter\u2019s bidding, all as their allies are healed and empowered with vigor far beyond mortal bounds.\n\nThis heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at its sibling. \n\nNo one is certain whether it was the creator\u2019s shame that led them to hide the scepter, or if their enemies cast it out of memory for fear of its power. What is known is that the legend of the _Dread Caduceus_ has endured and that whispers of its whereabouts have not been silenced by time.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_ you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Dread Caduceus_, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead. \n\n**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.\n\n**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a _long or short rest_ . You also have _disadvantage_  on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn. When you reduce the _Dread Caduceus_ to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a _wish_  spell).\n\n**Cherub**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet: \n\n_**Heal.**_ The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge. \n\n**_Healing Nimbus (3 Charges)_**. A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.\n\n_**Invulnerability (3 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_**Exhaustless (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to _fatigue_  for 1d6 days.\n\n_**Resistance (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.\n\n**_Cure (10 Charges)_**. The creature is healed of any _curses_ , _diseases_ , _poisons_ , or other negative effects, even if a _wish_  spell has previously been unsuccessful.\n\n_**Invigorate (10 Charges).**_ The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1\\. A creature can only benefit from this property once. \n\n**Skull**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the skull head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 100 feet: \n\n_**Animate Skeleton (1 Charge).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating the skeleton of its body to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _skeleton template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_. \n\n_**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _zombie template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus._\n\n_**Empower Undead (2 Charges).**_ Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.\n\n**_Animate Legion (6 Charges)._** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into _zombies_ . \n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the _Dread Caduceus._ When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command. You may decide the action the undead takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as guarding an area. If not given a command, the undead only defends itself. The undead continues to follow a command until its task is complete. \n\nIn addition, any creature you animate in this fashion retains injuries or disfigurements that were upon its corpse, and it continues to decompose.",

When in conflict the eye shuts and you no longer gain any of the eye\u2019s benefits or properties except for Shared Paranoia. The eye only opens again if you divulge an important secret or the information initially withheld. \n\n_**Destroying the Eye.**_ The eye is unbreakable but it has the power to implode and disintegrate itself. Success on a DC 28 Deception check convinces the eye that some horrifying and frightening threat is inevitably soon to befall it. Rather than accept its fate, the eye destroys itself and blinks out of existence. On a failed check, the creature permanently loses the eye\u2019s trust and the eye will never attune to it or be convinced by its Deception checks.",

Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.\n\n---\n\n__**Table: Figurine of Wondrous Power**__\n| **Figurine**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                   | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Bronze Griffin**     | Rare       | 5,000 gp  | Griffon feather                           | This bronze figurine is of a griffon in an aggressive posture.

Odin thrust the sword it into a tree and proclaimed that anyone who pulled it from the tree would receive the sword itself as a gift, and that none had ever borne a finer blade. Sigmund drew it, only for Odin to eventually break the blade after he had used it in several battles. The two halves were bequeathed to his son, Sigurd.\n\n_Gram_ was reforged by the dwarf Regin for Sigurd in order to slay Regin\u2019s brother, the wizard-turned-dragon, Fafnir, and reclaim a cursed treasure. Sigurd proofed the blade on Regin\u2019s own anvil, breaking the blade again, and then again after a second forging. Finally, on the third time, it split the anvil in half with a single stroke. Sigurd later killed Fafnir by hiding in a ditch and thrusting upwards into the drake\u2019s unprotected belly. The ditch carried away most of the dragon\u2019s burning, poisonous blood but _Gram_, as well as Sigrud\u2019s arm up to the shoulder, were bathed in it, and a portion of that venomous malice remains in the sword.

It has the following additional properties. \n\n_**Red Reaping.**_ Whenever you use _Harvest_ to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature\u2019s soul and stores it within. _Harvest_ cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature\u2019s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.\n\n_**Sow the Reaped.**_ You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature\u2019s soul stored within _Harvest._ This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.\n\n_**Only Life May Die.** Harvest_ has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them. \n\n_**Sentience.** Harvest_ is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17\\. It sees and hears using your senses. _Harvest_ communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.\n\n_**Personality.**_ This sickle originally had a much more benign purpose, created by a halfling archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. _Harvest_ has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. _Harvest_ tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its \u201cculling\u201d. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth\u2019s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you\u2019ll be in conflict with _Harvest_. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into _Harvest_. \n\n_**Destroying Harvest.**_ _Harvest_ is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering _Harvest_ an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.",

If you do not have enough hit dice to meet the cost, the effect fails.\n\nIf the lantern has 6 or more charges, the radius of its _bright light_  is doubled. If the lantern has 0 charges, it sheds no light. Charges can be expended in the following ways using your reaction (unless otherwise noted):\n\n* Allies in the lantern\u2019s bright light can use their reaction to spend 1 charge to add 1d12 to an _attack roll_ , _ability check_ , or _saving throw_  after it\u2019s rolled. You can use your own reaction to disallow this use.\n* When a creature in the lantern\u2019s bright light is reduced to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 or more charges to roll 1d12 per charge expended. The creature is conscious with hit points equal to the result.\n* When a creature in the lantern\u2019s bright light takes damage, you can project a shield over them. The damage is negated, and the lantern loses 1 charge per 10 damage negated (minimum 1).\n* When a creature in the lantern\u2019s bright light is targeted by a spell or would be caught in the area of a spell, you can negate the spell\u2019s effect on that creature. The lantern loses charges equal to the spell\u2019s level.\n\nIf _hope\u2019s final light_ is missing any charges at dawn, roll 1d8\\. On a 1, nothing happens. Otherwise, it regains all lost charges.\n\n_**Curse.**_ Hope\u2019s final light is a dangerous burden. If you have 0 hit dice remaining after providing charges to it, you are pulled into the lantern and are impossible to resurrect except by the direct intervention of a deity.

You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, returning it to an inert and inactive state.\n\n__**Table: Ioun Stones**__\n| **Type**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                                                               | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| ------------------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Absorption         | Very rare  | 10,000 gp | Refined negative energy                                                               | While this white marble sphere orbits your head, when a creature you can see casts a spell of 4th-level or lower targeting only you, you can use your reaction to have the stone harmlessly absorb the spell, suffering no damage or negative effects.

Some historians believe its translation ends with \u2018wounding wand\u2019 while others claim it is \u2018wounding twig\u2019, similar to the word for magic staff (gambantein). Either way it is this weapon and this weapon only that can kill the golden rooster V\u00ed\u00f0\u00f3pnir (which sits in the branches of Yggdrasil and may be tied to Ragnar\u00f6k, or possibly be another name for Gullinkambi) so that its wing joints (the only things that will suffice) can be used to distract the dogs guarding the flame-encircled castle holding Mengl\u00f6\u00f0, a maiden fated to be married to the hero Svipdagr. The runed weapon awaits within however, protected by the j\u00f6tunn Sinmara (a _storm giant_ ) who will only exchange it for a tail feather from the golden rooster\u2014that can only be harmed by the very same sword, creating a paradoxical task. Its forger and the owner of the chest that contains it can reveal the secrets to bypassing the 9 locks holding its prison closed, although Loki would only ever do so if a cunning price is attached...\n\nL\u00c6VATEINN\n\nUntil you are attuned to this staff, it appears to be a rotting quarterstaff or battered longsword. After you have attuned to it however, runes glow along the length of the wood or the blade.\n\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While wielding it, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a magic longsword or back.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical weapon (whichever form it is in when the last charge is expended).\n\nWhile it is in staff form, the runes grant access to magic.\n\n_**Spell Runes.**_ You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff\u2019s charges to activate a rune and cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks): __hideous laughter_  (1 charge), _speak with animals_  (1 charge), _pass without trace_  (2 charges), _dispel magic_  (3 charges), _speak with plants_  (3 charges), __confusion_  (4 charges), __glibness_  (8 charges). You can also use an action to cast the __charm person , disguise self ,_ or __vicious mockery_  spells from the staff without using any charges.\n\nWhile it is in longsword form, the runes channel magic with less finesse and unleash lethal energies.\n\n_**Death Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing shadows to flow out from the weapon for 1 minute. These shadows reduce _dim light_  in a 40-foot radius to _darkness_ , and bright light in a 20-foot radius to dim light. While the weapon is shadowed, it deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to any target it hits. The shadows last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, the duration expires, or until you drop the weapon.\n\n_**Flame Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing flames to erupt from the weapon for 1 minute. These flames shed _bright light_  in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits.

      "desc": "  \nThis vessel at first appears to be a Gargantuan sea monster 230 feet long by 30 feet in height and width, its body covered in hard reflective scales. Along the top there is a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch revealing a cylinder wide enough for a Medium creature to crawl inside. The _Nautilus_ is a Gargantuan object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 25  \n**Hit Points:** 400 (damage threshold 20)  \n**Speed** swim 200 ft. (can turn a maximum of 15 degrees in a round)  \n**Damage Immunities** poison, psychic  \n**Crew Capacity** 25; **Passenger Capacity** 600  \n**Travel Pace** 58 miles per hour (460 miles per day)\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the _Nautilus_ requires one pilot at the helm. While the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.\n\nThe steel submarine holds enough air for 15,000 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside (at most 625 for 24 hours). There are 2 decks of interior compartments, most of which are 6 feet high. Interior doors are airtight, have AC 20 and 50 hit points, and can be bypassed with DC 18 Dexterity (thieves\u2019 tools) checks or DC 25 Strength checks.\n\nThe _Nautilus_ floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 9,000 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature at the helm can use an action to pilot the _Nautilus_ by making a DC 18 Intelligence (vehicle \\[water\\]) check, with disadvantage if there are no other creatures controlling the ballasts, hydraulics, and sensors (each an action), or with _advantage_  if each position has a creature helping. On a success, the pilot can double the effects of any acceleration, deceleration, or turning they make with the _Nautilus_ on their turn. In addition, the pilot can send the submarine careening into a creature or object, making an attack roll as usual.\n\n_**Prow.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (8d6+6) piercing damage. On a natural 1, the Nautilus takes 34 (8d6+6) bludgeoning damage.\n\nAny creature in the command room can pull a lever to activate its function, but the _Nautilus_ only responds to the first 8 levers pulled in a round, and a lever only performs a function once per round. While traveling forward the lever to travel backwards does not function, and while traveling backward the level to travel forwards does not function. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position.\n\n__Nautilus Controls__\n| Lever | Up                                                                                                                                                              | Down                                                                        |\n| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1     | Forward window shutter opens.                                                                                                                                   | Forward window shutter closes.                                              |\n| 2     | Side window shutters open (20 per side).                                                                                                                        | Side window shutters close (20 per side).                                   |\n| 3     | Two manipulator arms extend from the front of the Nautilus.                                                                                                     | The manipulator arms retract.                                               |\n| 4     | Each extended manipulator arm makes the following _melee weapon attack_: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit_: The target is _grappled_  (escape DC 20). | One or both extended manipulator arms release what they are holding.        |\n| 5     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates forward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                 | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 6     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates backward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 7     | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees left.                                                                                                                           | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees right.                                      |\n| 8     | Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 150 feet.                                                               | The light turns off.                                                        |\n| 9     | The _Nautilus_ sinks as much as 50 feet in liquid.                                                                                                              | The _Nautilus_ rises up to 50 feet in liquid.                               |\n| 10    | The top hatch unseals and opens.                                                                                                                                | The top hatch closes and seals.                                             |",

Both effects last until you are no longer attuned to the orb.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you cannot choose to end your attunement to it. In addition, the orb can innately cast __suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18) to compel you to commit evil acts that serve its purposes\u2014exacting revenge, attaining its freedom, spread suffering and ruin, encourage the worship of foul draconic deities, collect the other _orbs of dragonkind_, or whatever else the Narrator deems fit. \n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is an _Orb of Dragonkind,_ an artifact with the power to control dragons. \n\n**DC 20** Five orbs were made, each containing the soul of an evil dragon.\n\n**DC 25** The orb can summon evil dragons, but does not actually control them.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nAn _Orb of Dragonkind_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment.\n\n**Magic**\n\nWhile you are controlling an _Orb of Dragonkind,_ you can use an action to cast detect magic at will. You can also expend 1 or more charges to cast _detect magic_ (no charge), __daylight  (_1 charge), __death ward_  (2 charges), _cure wounds_  (5th-level version, 3 charges), or __scrying_ (save DC 18; 3 charges). \n\n**The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges each dawn.**\n\n**Call Dragons**\n\nWhile you are controlling an _Orb of Dragonkind_, you can use an action to send a telepathic message in a 40-mile radius. Evil dragons that are mortal and in the area are compelled to take the quickest and most direct route to the orb, though they may not be friendly or pleased with being forced to answer the call. Once this property has been used, you cannot use it again for 1 hour.\n\n**Destroying an Orb**\n\nDespite its glass appearance, an _Orb of Dragonkind_ is immune to most types of damage (including draconic breath weapons and natural attacks), but they can be destroyed by the __disintegrate_ spell or a single strike from a weapon with a +3 magical bonus to attack and damage rolls.",

When unfolded, the item creates a hole 10 feet deep that leads to a cylindrical extra dimensional space which cannot be used to create open passages.

In a similar fashion, the body of a dead creature placed in the portable hole cannot be restored to life by __revivify , raise dead_ , or other similar magic. Breathing creatures inside a closed _portable hole_ can survive for up to 2d4 minutes divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to _suffocate_ .\n\nCreatures inside the hole while it\u2019s open can exit the hole by simply climbing out. A creature still within the hole can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check to escape as it is being closed. On a success, the creature appears within 5 feet of the item or creature carrying it.\n\nPlacing a _portable hole_ inside another extradimensional storage device such as a _bag of holding_ or __handy haversack_  results in planar rift that destroys both items and pulls everything within 10 feet into the Astral Plane. The rift then closes and disappears.",

      "desc": "Ancient beyond meaning, the Devouring King known as Nyth\u2019Zerogg spreads across the multiverse, infecting a plane with a portion of himself before consuming it. Whether summoned or drawn by hunger, the mind-bending entity crosses black seas of infinity to gorge upon mortal civilizations and gods alike.\n\nRarely in the uncounted eons of his existence, the spore of the Devouring King is denied. In this reality primordial powers drove him back before he took root, destroying him almost completely. Of his titanic form only a piece of skull, a fragment of wing membrane, and a piece of its strange heart survived. Nyth'zerogg's might was such that even these pieces contain terrible power, housing a fragment of his essence and a shard of his alien psyche.\n\nSince Nyth\u2019Zerogg\u2019s destruction pieces of the raiment have shown up throughout history, ultimately destroying their bearers and causing untold devastation. The destruction that they have wrought is insignificant compared to the danger that they pose however, as these artifacts hold the key to restoring the spore of Nyth\u2019Zerogg so that he may consume all reality. The _Raiment of the Devouring King_ consists of three pieces: a cloak, a crown, and an orb. To attune to a piece, you must awaken it by pouring the blood of a recently sacrificed sapient creature onto it, allowing you to graft it to your body in a process that takes a minute, during which you are _incapacitated_  by agony. Once attuned, pieces can only be removed if you are killed.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is part of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ the remains of an ancient being who consumed worlds. \n\n**DC 18** There are three surviving pieces of the raiment: a cloak, a crown, and an orb.\n\n**DC 21** The cloak grants flight and teleportation, the crown transforms the wearer\u2019s body, and the orb enhances their mind.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nWhile you are attuned to any piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ you are subject to Malignant Influence (see below) and gain the following benefits:\n\n* You cease aging and become immune to poison and disease.\n* You gain a pool of 8 charges that can be spent to fuel the _Raiment of the Devouring King\u2019s_ magical properties (save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). You regain 1d4+1 charges each dusk.\n\n**A Complete Set**\n\nBecause of their powerful desire to be together, no matter how many pieces of the Raiment of the Devouring King you wear they count as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement. For each additional piece of the Raiment of the Devouring King that you acquire, you gain the following benefits:\n\n**_Two Pieces._** Your pool of charges increases to 12\\. You can use an action to regain 1 expended charge by messily devouring an _incapacitated_  or _unconscious_  creature within your reach, killing it in the process. Creatures slain in this manner can only be returned to life by means of a _wish_ or __true resurrection ._\n\n_**Three Pieces.**_ Your pool of charges increases to 16\\. When you take a _short rest_ , you can extend tendrils into the ground and regain 1d4+1 charges by consuming natural energy within a 1-mile radius. All plant life in the area dies and beasts become _poisoned_  while in the area. This property can only be used in an area once per decade, after which it cannot support life for the next 10 years.\n\nYou cannot be permanently killed unless each piece of the raiment is cut from your body in conjunction with a carefully worded __wish_ spell. Instead, you return to life 1d3 days later.\n\n**Cloak of the Devouring King**\n\nThis deep jade cloak resembles a large piece of torn wing membrane. When attuned, it grafts to your back, reweaving muscle and bone and turning into a single leathery wing that grants a portion of Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s vitality.\n\n While attuned to the _Cloak of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Constitution score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Constitution is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a fly speed equal to your Speed.\n* You regain 1d8 hit points at the beginning of each of your turns if you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, you regrow the missing part within 1d6 days.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: _longstrider_ (1 charge), __misty step_  (2 charges), __blink_ (3 charges), _dimension door_  (4 charges), __plane shift_  (5 charges), or _teleport_ (5 charges)\n\n**Crown of the Devouring King**\n\nThe alabaster crown resembles a jagged piece of flat bone affixed to a crude iron band. When worn, it settles so that a single spoke of bone extends above the wearer's eye. When you attune to the skull, it grafts with your bone and grants a portion of Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s strength.\n\nWhile attuned to the _Crown of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your Strength score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if your Strength is equal to or greater than 20.\n* Your body transforms, turning a rubbery gray green as chitinous bone plates emerge from your skin. This counts as a suit of _1 leather_ if you are proficient with light armor, a suit of _1 breastplate_  if you are proficient with medium armor, or a suit of   _1 full plate_  if you are proficient with heavy armor. This armor does not impose _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You can use an action to spend 1 charge to shape chitin and bone from your body into a +1 weapon. You may only have two such weapons in existence at a time. Any ammunition needed is created as the weapon is fired. You may spend 1 charge as part of an action to deliver touch spells through a weapon created in this manner by making a single weapon attack as a part of that action. A weapon created in this manner crumbles to dust a round after it leaves your person.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __shield_  (1 charge), __enlarge/reduce_  (2 charges), __protection from energy_ (self only; 2 charges), _stoneskin_ (self only; 3 charges).\n\n**Orb of the Devouring King**\n\nThis crimson orb resembles a massive, calcified heart suspended on a crude chain. When the orb returns to life, hooked tendrils extend and burrow into your chest, lodging it there where it grants a portion of the god\u2019s mind and knowledge.\n\n While attuned to the _Orb of the Devouring King_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Choose Intelligence or Charisma. The chosen ability score is increased to 20\\. This property has no effect if the chosen ability score is equal to or greater than 20.\n* You gain a 1d10 expertise die on Intelligence checks.\n* When you take a short rest, you can recover an expended spell slot of 6th-level or higher by spending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot recovered.\n* You may expend one or more charges to cast the following spells: __detect thoughts_ (1 charge)_, suggestion_ (2 charges), __black tentacles_ (3 charges), _telekinesis_  (4 charges), _dominate monster_  (5 charges).\n\n**Malignant Influence**\n\nEach piece of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ longs to be united with the others so that Nyth\u2019Zerogg may live again. While attuned to a piece of the artifact, you must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom _saving throw_  once per month or gain a level of Malignant Influence, which cannot be removed while you are attuned to the _Raiment of the Devouring King._ With two pieces of the artifact attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per week, and when all three pieces of the artifact are attuned, you repeat the saving throw once per day.\n\n_**Level 1**._ You become obsessed with acquiring the other pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ and devote all of the time and resources at your disposal to the task.\n\n_**Level 2.**_ You become ravenous and must consume one living sapient being each day or gain a level of _fatigue_  that persists until you consume such a creature.\n\n_**Level 3.**_ You fall entirely under the sway of the Raiment of the Devouring King. You gain the Chaotic and Evil alignment traits, and you will stop at nothing to see Nyth\u2019Zerogg reborn. You immediately become an NPC under the Narrator\u2019s control.\n\n**Awakening Nyth\u2019Zerogg**\n\nIf all three pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King_ graft to a single host and they acquire three levels of Malignant Influence, the host\u2019s mind and soul are devoured as fuel for Nyth\u2019zerogg\u2019s reawakening. The exact consequences of such a reawakening are left to the Narrator but likely pose an extinction level threat to mortals and gods alike.\n\n**Destruction**\n\nMany attempts have been made to destroy pieces of the _Raiment of the Devouring King,_ yet they always reform. Some believe that they can only be destroyed by plunging a creature with all three pieces of the artifact grafted to its body into the heart of a star or a true flame in the center of the Elemental Plane of Fire\u2014though even this is just a theory.",

Gems can hold a maximum of 10 charges.\n\nAfter spending a minute meditating on the gem, you can spend a charge to regain 4d12 hit points. Alternately, once a week you can spend a minute meditating to keep yourself from aging for the next week. When a charge is spent, roll 1d10\\. If the result is higher than the number of charges remaining, the gem can no longer be recharged and will shatter when its final charge is spent. Life gems are typically discovered with 1d4 charges.\n\n**_Curse._** Destroying a soul is a dark act that comes with many consequences. After using the Rhinam life gem, you may find yourself accosted by celestials and fiends alike, seeking either to destroy the object or obtain it for their own reasons. In addition, the Narrator may rule that using the life gem too many times means you gain the Evil alignment and emit a strong evil aura for the purposes of any feature, spell, or trait that detects or affects Evil creatures.",

An absorbed spell has no effect and its energy is stored within the rod. The spell\u2019s energy equals the spell levels used to cast it. The rod can store up to 50 spell levels worth of energy over the course of its existence. The rod cannot hold more than 50 spell levels worth of energy. If the rod does not have the space to store a spell and you try to absorb it, the rod has no effect.\n\nAfter attuning to the rod you know how much energy it currently contains and how much it has held over the course of its existence. A spellcaster can expend the energy in the rod and convert it to spell slots\u2014for example, you can expend 3 spell levels of energy from the rod to cast a 3rd-level spell, even if you no longer have the spell slots to cast it. The spell must be a spell you know or have prepared, at a level you can cast it, and no higher than 5th-level.\n\nWhen found the rod contains 1d10 spell levels. A rod that can no longer store energy and no longer has any energy remaining within it loses its magical properties.",

      "desc": "In size and shape this massive construct is not unlike a squat _hill giant_ \u2014if hill giants were made of metal, leather, wood, and glass. With all manner of wheels, gears, cables, and hinges, when worn its movements are surprisingly fluid, if somewhat loud and heavy.\n\nThe last of its kind, the _Serveros War Engine_ was used by a forgotten empire's soldiers in wars that spread far beyond their kingdom. It\u2019s hard to imagine there may once have been entire armies outfitted with these magical constructs and engaged in battle against one another, and impossible to conceive of the untold destruction they wrought.\n\nMounting the war engine is a fairly straightforward matter. As you enter the construct, you can don a helm and belt, both connected to the war engine, which allow you to attune to and control the construct. The construct is not sentient and moves only when controlled in this way.\n\nWhen controlling the construct, you form a psychic bond with it, seeing through its eyes, moving with its limbs, and experiencing pain through its body.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Serveros War Engine_, the last war machine of a forgotten empire. \n\n**DC 18** The engine is piloted from inside, and only those with mental and physical fortitude can endure it. In addition to offering great might, it can manifest arcane blades, cannons, and other effects.\n\n**DC 21** Destroying the engine requires destroying the helm, which is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Serveros War Engine_ has one lesser artifact benefit. Piloting the war engine can be quite taxing, both mentally and physically. You gain no benefits from a _long or short rest_  while mounted in the war engine, and when you expend its last available charge you suffer both a level of _fatigue_  and _strife_ .\n\nWhile you are attuned to, mounted inside, and controlling the _Serveros War Engine_, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* Your AC becomes 18.\n* Your Strength score becomes 21.\n* You are Huge-sized.\n* Your Speed becomes 40 feet.\n* You have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made to avoid being _grappled_  or knocked _prone_ .\n* You sustain only 1 hit point of damage for every 5 hit points of nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt to you.\n* Your unarmed strikes deal 4d8 bludgeoning damage.\n* Your weapon attacks count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.\n* You have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\n* You are vulnerable to psychic damage.\n\n**Charged Properties**\n\nThe war engine also has several built-in features, some of which are powered by stored electrical charges or drain energy from your life force.\n\n* A massive sword hilt is secured to the construct\u2019s hip by an incredible magnetic force. You can use a bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to draw the hilt and engage its plasma blade.\n\n_**Plasma Blade**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8+5) radiant damage, or 21 (3d10+5) radiant damage if wielded in two hands.\n\n* An arcane cannon is housed in the construct\u2019s left forearm. You can use an action or bonus action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the arcane cannon.\n\n_**Arcane Cannon**_. _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 120/300 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (2d6) radiant damage.\n\n* The construct\u2019s right hand is detachable. You can use an action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to fire the gauntlet as a projectile.\n\n_**Gauntlet Grapple.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 60/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 23 (4d8+5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d6+5) bludgeoning damage and if the target is a Large or smaller creature it is _grappled_ . You can use a bonus action to retract the hand up to 120 feet and reconnect it to the construct. A grappled target moves with the hand.\n\n The _Serveros War Engine_ begins with 1d20 charges. By making a DC 18 Intelligence (Engineering) check, 2d10 charges can be restored during a _long rest_ .\n\n**Warframe Variations**\n\nThe Narrator may apply one or more of the following variant options if desired.\n\n_**Airborne.**_ You can expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to unfold magical wings and gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute.\n\n_**Disrepair.**_ When first discovered, the _Serveros War Engine_ may be completely depleted of stored charges and heavily damaged, or perhaps almost completely dismantled. With maintenance, care, and careful reconstruction using Engineering (or a wish spell), it can be restored to its full, terrible power.\n\n_**Glass Jaw.**_ When the _Serveros War Engine_ takes a critical hit from an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the war engine\u2019s head is knocked off, disabling the artifact until it is repaired with a DC 23 Intelligence (Engineering) check and 8 hours of work.\n\n_**Mortal Echoes.**_ The _Serveros War Engine\u2019s_ last pilot died while mounted within the war engine, and echoes of their psyche still linger within the construct. When first attempting to attune to the artifact, you relive the final moments of the dead pilot and make a DC 18 Charisma _saving throw_ . On a failure, you take 5 (1d10) psychic damage and gain a short-term _mental stress effect_ .\n\n**_Nautical._** You gain a swim speed of 40 feet. In addition, you can use an action to either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to seal the cockpit and fill it with breathable air which lasts for 1 hour.\n\n_**Recon.**_ You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet and can either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to activate magical floating discs on the soles of the construct\u2019s feet. The discs last for 1 hour during which time the construct does not cause you to have _disadvantage_  on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and you leave no tracks on the ground.\n\n_**Serveros Slayer.**_ In lieu of the arcane cannon and detachable fist, the construct is equipped with a psyblade in each hand. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to deploy one or both psyblades. \n\n_**Psyblade.** Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) psychic damage.\n\n_**Specialized Weaponry**_. Instead of a giant plasma sword, the _Serveros War Engine_ has one of the following weapons. You can use a bonus action and either expend 1 charge or take 5 (2d4) force damage to equip and activate the weapon.\n\n_**Discus Throwing Shield**. Melee_ or _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ reach 5 ft. or range 40/80 ft., one target, or if thrown two targets within 10 feet of each other. Hit: 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning damage. In addition, while the shield is donned your AC increases by 2.\n\n_**Extendable Metal Staff**_. _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (3d6+5) bludgeoning, or 18 (3d8+5) bludgeoning damage when wielded with two hands, and a Large or smaller target makes a DC 18 Strength _saving throw_  or is knocked _prone_ .\n\n_**Shocking Net.**_ _Ranged Weapon Attack_: range 30/60 ft., all targets in a 15-foot square area. _Hit:_ 9 (2d8) lightning damage and the target is _grappled_ . At the start of your turn, conscious creatures grappled by the net take 9 (2d8) lightning damage. This weapon cannot damage a creature with 0 hit points.\n\n_**Sonic War Hammer.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack_: reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (3d8+5) thunder damage, or 21 (3d10+5) thunder damage when wielded with two hands.\n\n**Destroying the War Engine**\n\nOf all its various parts and components the key to disabling and ultimately destroying the war engine is the helm. The rest of the massive construct might feasibly be replaced or reengineered by an ingenious mind. However with its complex structure, both magical and mechanical, replicating the controller headpiece requires arcane knowledge and technical documentation that disappeared with the war engine\u2019s creators long ago. \n\nThe helm is heavily enchanted with fortifications against harm. Bypassing its magical protections requires two steps: first, a __dispel magic_ cast at 5th-level or higher is needed to make the invisible barrier around the war engine\u2019s helm vulnerable for 6 seconds, followed by a __disintegrate_ spell cast at 7th-level or higher to completely dissolve the barrier. Once the barrier is dissolved, for the next 24 hours the helm can be destroyed like any other item (AC 22, 100 hit points) before its magical protections regenerate and fully repair it.",

Any creatures summoned by the sword obey your commands and remain for 1 hour or until they drop to 0 hit points.\n\n### Lore\n\nSkofnung was the blade of the legendary king Hrolf Kraki. It was renowned for its supernatural sharpness, the hardness of its steel, and for the fact it was imbued with the spirits of his 12 most faithful berserkers. It later showed up in multiple different sagas, usually as a result of some new hero plundering it from Hrolf\u2019s tomb for one purpose or another.",

      "desc": "A huge red ruby is set into the pommel of this intricately filigreed golden longsword. The jewel shimmers and shines as the blade speaks in a voice that resonates with a deep and distant baritone. Without this illusion, a twisted demonic form is revealed: the blade is composed of a single sharpened tooth, what appears to be the hilt is instead a grotesque sucker-like mouth, and the ruby pommel is a figment covering a single great crimson eye that stares with fiendish intelligence.\n\nYou have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic longsword. An intense burning heat radiates from the blade and it deals an extra 3d6 fire damage on a successful hit. \n\n_**Attached Properties.**_ While attached to _Skrivena Moc,_ you gain resistance to fire, proficiency with longswords, and after taking the Attack action on your turn you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack using it. However, the weapon forms a permanent bond with its wielder and cannot be put down or removed once wielded.\n\n_**Corruption.**_ At the end of each week that _Skrivena Moc_ is attached to you, your Charisma score is decreased by 1d4\\. When you have lost 6 or more Charisma in this way, raised black veins radiate out from the point of _Skrivena Moc\u2019s_ attachment. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until _Skrivena Moc_ is no longer attached to you, at which point you recover 1 Charisma at the end of each long rest.\n\n_**Fiend Transformed.**_ This elegantly crafted longsword of filigreed gold whispers promises of greater treasures to come\u2014yet those who wield it are doomed. In truth it is an imprisoned _balor_  reduced in power by potent enchantments, the elegant blade only an illusion. Any that dare grasp the infernal hilt know not their peril, unaware they are actually plunging their hand into a fiendish maw.\n\n_**Sentience.** Skrivena Moc_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 20, Wisdom 16, and Charisma 22\\. It has hearing and truesight to a range of 120 feet. The longsword communicates with you telepathically and can speak and understand Abyssal, Common, and up to 3 other languages of the Narrator\u2019s choice.\n\n_**Personality.**_ _Skrivena Moc_ needs a wielder to accomplish much of anything and it is a peerless manipulator. Wrathful and vindictive, the fiend blade sees those who carry it as insignificant and a means to an end. However it has been stuck in this form for centuries and has learned to maintain a helpful and subservient fa\u00e7ade to better facilitate the careful orchestration of events whenever possible, only revealing its true intentions as a last resort. Once wielded, the fiend blade grabs hold and cannot be dropped. The demon makes hasty apologies for its \u201ccurse\u201d, manipulating its wielder into serving its will\u2014it acts as a powerful weapon but slowly drains away their vital essences until they die, all the while using them to track down potential cures for its transformation.\n\n**Forgotten Fiend**\n\nLong ago Skrivena Moc was defeated by the great elven wizard Stariji. Rather than banish the demon and allow it to reform in the Abyss, the mage transformed the evil monster into something more useful: a sword to bestow upon her champions. It suffered for centuries as a tool of justice, made to forcefully cut down hundreds of fiends in the name of its most hated enemy. After nearly a millennium of belligerent service however, Stariji finally succumbed to her age and died peacefully in her bed. With the elven wizard and all her champions gone Skrivena Moc was left to molder deep within its cursed enemy\u2019s home amongst other treasures\u2014but as centuries passed it eventually was discovered and has escaped to wreak havoc on the world once more.\n\nSkrivena Moc constructs a web of lies, propping itself up as Stariji\u2019s most trusted warrior who chose to serve the elven mage against evil even after death. It promises everything an adventurer could want and more if only they\u2019ll wield it\u2014and the demon keeps its promises, in a way. The fiend blade is powerful even in untrained hands, though it is also full of deception. Whatever lies and half-truths the sword produces, it has only one goal in mind: Skrivena Moc wishes to return to its true demonic form. Stariji\u2019s old enchantment has weakened over the centuries and allowed for some of its fiendish essence to leach out, but it still cannot escape the mage\u2019s trap. As it seems the old wizard never shared her techniques, Skrivena Moc must find her spellbook, the only known source that contains the techniques to restore its form. Even death cannot save it, as the mage ensured that it cannot be destroyed only to reform in the Abyss while in this cursed shape.\n\n**Skrivena Moc, Whispering Blade Challenge 4+**\n\n_Small fiend_ 1,100 XP+\n\n**Armor Class** 19 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 180 (19d6+114)\n\n**Speed** 0 ft.\n\n**STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA**\n\n26 (+8)15 (+2)22 (+6)20 (+5)16 (+3)22 (+6)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver DC** 19\n\n**Saving Throws** Con +8, Wis +5, Cha +8\n\n**Skills** Arcana +9, Deception +10, History +9, Insight +7, Intimidation +10, Investigation +9, Perception +7, Persuasion +10\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** fire, poison\n\n**Condition Immunities** _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17\n\n**Languages** Abyssal, Common, telepathy 120 ft.\n\n_**Death Throes.**_ When Skrivena Moc dies it explodes and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity _saving throw_ , taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites unattended flammable objects in the area. Any creature currently attached to Skrivena Moc has _disadvantage_  on this save.\n\n_**Demonic Blade.**_ While Skrivena Moc is attached to a creature, the creature gains the attached template.\n\n_**Immobile.**_ Skrivena Moc has been magically forced into the form of a blade and is unable to move on its own. It is considered _restrained_  and automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and _saving throws_ .\n\n_**Magic Resistance**_. Skrivena Moc has _advantage_  on _saving throws_  against spells and other magical effects.\n\n**_Prized Glamer._** Skrivena Moc has an illusion around it that makes it look and feel like a golden longsword. Creatures who physically interact with the figment can determine that the sword is glamored with a DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check. Skrivena Moc can use a bonus action to activate or dismiss this illusion.\n\n_**Variable Challenge Rating.**_ Skrivena Moc\u2019s CR is equal to its wielder\u2019s level or CR (minimum CR 4).\n\nACTIONS\n\n**_Corrupting Siphon (Recharge 5\u20136)_**. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Constitution _saving throw_  or reduces its Charisma by 2 (1d4). Skrivena Moc regains 1d8 hit points for each point of Charisma lost in this way. This Charisma loss cannot be healed until Skrivena Moc is no longer attached to the creature, at which point it recovers 1 Charisma at the end of each _long rest_ .\n\n_**Demonic Leeching (3/Day)**_. Skrivena Moc uses its natural resistances to filter out its wielder\u2019s ailments, ending either the _poisoned_  condition or one nonmagical _disease_  afflicting the attached creature.\n\n_**Grip of Control.**_ The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Wisdom _saving throw_  or temporarily loses control to the fiend blade until the end of Skrivena Moc\u2019s next turn (as __dominate person_ ).\n\n_**Trusty Blade**_. The creature attached to Skrivena Moc makes a DC 19 Charisma _saving throw_  or it is _charmed_  for the next hour. If the attached creature\u2019s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. \n\nREACTIONS\n\n_**Fiendish Attachment.**_ When a creature grasps Skrivena Moc\u2019s hilt, it can use reaction to attach to the creature. Once attached, the creature cannot let go and is forced to wield Skrivena Moc with whatever limb it used to grab the hilt. Skrivena Moc can use an action to detach from a creature and otherwise detaches when it dies, the attached limb is severed, or if it is dealt 35 or more radiant damage in a single round.\n\n_**Justified Paranoia**_. Whenever Skrivena Moc hears its name mentioned or is otherwise suspicious of a creature, it can use its reaction to telepathically delve into the creature\u2019s mind (as _detect thoughts_ ; save DC 19).",

      "desc": "The _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a jewel-pommeled blade with the power to transform into other weapons\u2014each specially suited for one of the eleven martial traditions. Originally called the _Sword of All Traditions,_ over time the gems in the pommel were lost and now only three remain. Should its lost gemstones be returned, the blade might be restored to its full spectrum of glory and power.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Sword of Three Traditions,_ which grants mastery of the techniques of combat. Each of the three gemstones in its hilt represents a tradition of combat.\n\n**DC 18** The sword can transform into other weapons based on the gemstones in its hilt.\n\n**DC 21** Only a dragon of the same color can destroy the sword\u2019s gemstones.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ has two lesser artifact benefits, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. For each of the first five magical gemstones restored to the sword, it gains 1 lesser artifact benefit. For each of the last three magical gemstones restored to it, the sword gains 1 greater artifact detriment and 1 greater artifact benefit.\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a   _1 longsword_ . Once you are attuned, you can use an action to turn the sword into a different _1 weapon ._ In addition, when you use a combat maneuver, the sword automatically changes into the weapon associated with that tradition. To change into a given weapon, the gem associated with that tradition must be attached. \n\nWhile holding the sword, when you use a combat maneuver of a tradition associated with an attached gem, its exertion cost is reduced by 1 (minimum 1 exertion).\n\n**Magical Gemstones**\n\nEach of the lost magical gemstones of the _Sword of Three Traditions_ is a wondrous item and artifact that requires attunement. Once attuned to a magical gemstone, it bestows a minor artifact benefit. You can only attune to the magical gemstone if you know a combat maneuver from the tradition associated with it. \n\nYou can use an action to attach a magical gemstone to the sword. No matter how many magical gemstones are attached to the sword, it counts as a single magic item for the purposes of attunement.\n\nThe sword normally comes affixed with its diamond, peridot, and sapphire (for the Adamant Mountain, Rapid Current, and Razor\u2019s Edge traditions), but the Narrator may choose to have different magical gemstones attached to it or determine them randomly. \n\nWhen the sword turns into more than one item, the +1 bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  only apply to any weapons created (there are no bonuses bestowed to the ammunition or shield). The additional objects materialize either in the attuned creature\u2019s off-hand or strapped to their back. Any such item created by the sword disappears after 1 minute if it is no longer on your person, or when the sword changes shape again.\n\n The sword\u2019s power increases when 7 gems are in its pommel (turning it into a _2 weapon_  that reduces exertion costs by 2) or when fully restored with all 11 magical gemstones (turning it into a   _3 weapon_ that reduces exertion costs by 3). \n\n__**Table: Sword of Three Traditions**__\n| **1d12** | **Tradition**       | **Weapon**                        | **Gem**    |\n| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 1        | Razor\u2019s Edge        | Longsword                         | Diamond    |\n| 2        | Adamant Mountain    | Greatsword                        | Peridot    |\n| 3        | Rapid Current       | Two shortswords                   | Sapphire   |\n| 4        | Biting Zephyr       | Longbow and quiver with 10 arrows | Pearl      |\n| 5        | Mirror\u2019s Glint      | Saber and light shield            | Opal       |\n| 6        | Mist and Shade      | Dagger                            | Aquamarine |\n| 7        | Sanguine Knot       | Bastard sword                     | Garnet     |\n| 8        | Spirited Steed      | Lance                             | Topaz      |\n| 9        | Tempered Iron       | Morningstar                       | Amethyst   |\n| 10       | Tooth and Claw      | Battleaxe                         | Ruby       |\n| 11       | Unending Wheel      | Rapier                            | Emerald    |\n| 12       | Adventurer\u2019s choice | \\-                                | \\-         |\n\n### **Seekers of the Sword**\n\nThe _Sword of Three Traditions_ is sought after by power hungry and righteous warriors alike, and any search for the fabled blade is certain to cause conflict with some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Sword**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                              |\n| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| 1       | _Warrior_  on training pilgrimage          |\n| 2       | Despot with a band of raiders              |\n| 3       | Master martial artist who tests the worthy |\n| 4       | Spellsword in search of secrets            |\n| 5       | Greedy _assassin_  or _thief_              |\n| 6       | Greedy _assassin_  or _thief_              |\n\n### **Destroying the Sword**\n\nThe power which binds the _Sword of Three Traditions_ is located in its magical gemstones.

It\u2019s magical properties become apparent however when it moves, as it stands on hundreds of tiny humanoid legs and opens to reveal a long red tongue and a rim dotted with sharp teeth. It functions like a typical chest with the following additional properties.\n\n**_Mimic-Like._** _The Traveling Chest_ can use an action to appear to be a mundane chest, and you can verbally command it to do so. While mimicking a normal chest in this way it is indistinguishable from its mundane counterpart.\n\n_**Multiple Interiors.** The Traveling Chest_ has 1,000 different interior spaces, each 5 feet wide, 3 feet deep, and 3 feet tall. You can verbally request any particular space (such as the last one, or the one with my laundry in it) and when opened the chest reveals that interior. Otherwise the chest opens to reveal a random interior space. While the chest is closed, all of its interior spaces are located within separate pocket dimensions. These pocket dimensions have no air, and any Supply stored within them instantly deteriorates and rots as if decades have passed as soon as the chest is closed. Only you can summon up the other interiors in this way, and any other creature that opens the chest only finds the \u201cfirst interior\u201d.\n\n_**Relentless.**_ Once you attune to _The Traveling Chest_, it relentlessly follows you until it sits no more than 15 feet away from you. The chest is magically aware of your location at all times, even if you are on a separate plane. If separated from you the chest travels towards you as fast as it can to the best of its ability and it attacks any creature that attempts to hinder its progress. If you are functionally unreachable, such as being on a different plane or across an ocean, the chest still progresses using even esoteric or hidden methods of reaching you such as magic portals or stowing away on ships headed in your direction.\n\n_**Imprinted.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ does not relinquish attunement once attuned, and you cannot voluntarily remove this attunement. If you attune to additional magic items beyond your limit, _The Traveling Chest_ always remains as one of your attuned items. \n\n_**Pack Lightly.** The Traveling Chest_ does not like being weighed down too much, and can carry a maximum of 10 bulky items. Any additional bulky items you attempt to store within it are spit out. \n\n_**Sentience.** The Traveling Chest_ is a sentient construct with Intelligence 3, Wisdom 14, and Charisma 12\\. It has blindsight to a range of 60 feet. _The Traveling Chest_ cannot speak or read, but it understands Common and Elvish. _The Traveling Ches_t lacks proper communication, but can animalistically communicate simple emotions (most often boredom or rage).\n\n_**Personality.**_ _The Traveling Chest_ has the intellect and temperament of a poorly trained dog. Loyalty has been branded magically into its psyche but its actual obedience is looser. The chest is playful and quick to anger, yet is utterly committed to following whomever is attuned to it. It also isn\u2019t a fighter and ignores outright commands to attack, though it defends itself in combat when it is attacked. It likes to be used for its intended purpose, happiest when numerous items are stored within it and regularly retrieved. If left idle or unused for more than a day it will come into conflict. While in conflict the chest intentionally opens to the wrong interior spaces, or remains indignantly locked, and it generally acts snippy and uncooperative. An apology and DC 14 Animal Handling or Persuasion check calms the chest down and ends the conflict, or if it feels genuinely mistreated, it can be offered a full wardrobe\u2019s worth of new clothing to store as a peace offering.\n\n---\n\n**The Traveling Chest Challenge 7**\n\n_Medium construct_ 2,900 XP\n\n**Armor Class** 18 (natural armor)\n\n**Hit Points** 119 (14d6+70)\n\n**Speed** 50 ft.\n\nSTR DEX CON INT WIS CHA\n\n18 (+4) 14 (+2) 20 (+5) 3 (\u20134) 14 (+2) 12 (+1)\n\n**Proficiency** +3; **Maneuver** DC 15\n\n**Damage Resistances** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, slashing from nonmagical weapons\n\n**Damage Immunities** necrotic, poison, thunder\n\n**Condition Immunities** _fatigued_ , _poisoned_ \n\n**Senses** blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 12\n\n**Languages** understands but can not speak Common, Elvish\n\n**_False Appearance._** While _The Traveling Chest_ remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary chest.\n\n_**Immutable Form**_.

If the target is a creature, it is _grappled_  (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is _restrained_ , and the chest can't bite another target.\n\n_**Swallow.**_ The chest makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is _grappling_ . If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is _blinded_  and _restrained_ , it has _total cover_  against attacks and other effects outside the chest, and it begins _suffocating_  at the start of each of the chest\u2019s turns. If the chest takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the chest regurgitates all swallowed creatures along with up to 1d10 other random items that were stored within it, all of which falls _prone_  in a space within 10 feet of the chest. If the chest dies, all swallowed creatures are no longer restrained by it, and they and any items reappear randomly in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of the destroyed chest. ",

This story typically takes 1 hour to read, continuing from where the last tale completed. \n\nWhen you speak another command word and use an action to expend all 3 charges, the story created when the book is opened is particularly engrossing and the reader must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom _saving throw_  or be enthralled, failing to notice anything that is not directly harmful. \n\nThe tome has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges each dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a result of 5 or less, the tome loses its magic and becomes a mundane item.",

Additionally, you can speak the blade\u2019s command word as a bonus action to cause it to shed _bright light_  in a 20-foot radius and _dim light_  for an additional 20 feet. Repeating the command word or sheathing the blade extinguishes the light. Objects hit with this sword take the maximum damage the weapon\u2019s damage dice can deal.\n\nTyrfing has 9 charges, which it does not regain while attuned to a creature. These charges are fully restored if a new creature attunes to it, but a previous bearer who attunes to the sword again only ever has the same pool of charges. When you use the sword to deal a critical hit against a creature that is not a construct or undead and has 100 or fewer hit points, it must make a DC 16 Constitution _saving throw_ . Each time a creature is killed in this manner the sword expends a charge.\n\n**_Curse._** Prior to 3 charges being expended from the blade, it will cause some tragedy or misfortune to befall you and will not expend its third charge until it has. The exact details and timing of this evil are up to the Narrator, but good examples include: causing you to automatically fail a crucial ability check (particularly one that would lead to further disaster, such as failing to identify an ally in the dark and accidentally attacking them); causing an ally who is reduced to 0 hit points to be incapable of rolling successes on death saving throws, leading to their death unless they are healed or stabilized by another creature; or causing all your next critical hits during a given combat to miss instead.\n\nMisfortune occurs again before 6 charges have been expended, and it will not expend the sixth until it has done so. Likewise, it must do so a third time before expending the final charge. If you break your attunement with Tyrfing with a pending misfortune, you remain _cursed_  until either the misfortune occurs or until you are targeted by a _remove curse_  spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot.\n\nOn expending the final charge, you must make a DC 16 constitution save. On a failure, you are slain by the sword just as surely as your opponent. On a success, you instead gain the _doomed_  condition, dying soon thereafter in a tragic manner unless powerful magic intervenes. Regardless of the result, Tyrfing then disappears. 1 week later it appears somewhere on your plane, searching for a new wielder to afflict.\n\n_Note:_ The exact mechanics of the following curse are for the Narrator and should be kept vague for players, even if they discover it is cursed. It is enough in that case for them to know Tyrfing will bring about three great evils and eventually the death of its wielder. The sword is nothing if not persistent, and attempts to leave it behind without breaking attunement merely mean that Tyrfing appears near its bearer 24 hours later.\n\n### Lore\n\nTyrfing was a sword forged under duress by the dwarves Svalinn and Durinn for Svafrlami, a king and grandson of Odin. Per his instructions, it shown with bright light, could cut through stone and steel as easily as flesh, and would never dull or rust. However, because their services were obtained under duress by threat of force, they also cursed the blade so that whenever drawn it would take a life, that it would bring about three great evils, and that it would eventually take Svafrlami\u2019s life. This all came to pass, and the sword continued to bring disaster and ruin to each new wielder, its cursed hunger for tragedy never sated.",

      "desc": "Few powers are more coveted than the ability to examine and manipulate the threads of fate, and yet destiny is a mystery that most have yet to fully comprehend. As enigmatic as the forces it commands, the origins of the Veil of Fate are unknown. It was brought to historical attention when it was revealed as the source of a renowned seer\u2019s remarkable abilities, her foretellings reached the ears of queens and generals, shaping a continent and undoubtedly the whole of history. Fearful of her influence and envious of the veil\u2019s power, those outside of her circle of influence conspired to behead her and take the relic. The subsequent fighting and intrigue saw the Veil of Fate become lost for centuries, occasionally appearing in tales as fantastic as they were inscrutable. While this tale is the best known, records of the Veil of Fate\u2019s existence can be traced to the beginnings of written history, its bearers painted as either titans of achievement or dire warnings to be heeded by the wise.\n\nThe Veil of Fate is a diaphanous silver and gray cloth attached to a thin silvery band which is worn on the bearer\u2019s head. When worn correctly, it falls to the floor around its bearer, covering them entirely in a faint silver shimmer. It is unknown whether or not this appearance is due purely to the physical nature of the veil or its powers taking the bearer slightly beyond the bounds of reality.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Veil of Fate_, which allows the wearer to see the very strands of destiny. \n\n**DC 18** The veil grants glimpses into the future.\n\n**DC 21** Many who have donned the veil are immediately struck by disturbingly accurate premonitions of the future.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Veil of Fate_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nWhen you are wearing and attuned to the veil, creatures have _disadvantage_  on _opportunity attacks_  against you as the combination of your enhanced foresight and diaphanous appearance bamboozles your foes.\n\nThe glimpses of the future granted by the _Veil of Fate_ are not always advantageous. You are always last in the initiative order as you are overwhelmed with insights into the events that are about to unfold, though you may choose to use your foretelling roll (see Control Fate below) for all of your initiative checks for the day.\n\nIn addition, you can impart some of the veil\u2019s power by falling into a deep meditation for 8 hours. When your meditation is concluded, your touch bestows one of the benefits of the _Veil of Fate_ onto an allied creature, and you suffer a level of _fatigue_  from the effort.\n\n**Foretelling**\n\nAt the Narrator\u2019s discretion, when you first attune to the Veil of Fate you are granted a detailed premonition of future events, presenting the opportunity to intertwine those threads of fate with your own. You can perfectly recall the premonition for a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 day), after which the memory is gone as if you never experienced it. Anything you write down or otherwise record about the premonition during this time is all that remains. Another creature may be given a different premonition or no premonition upon attuning to the veil. You can occasionally recall key details of the premonition at important crossroads in the future before the depicted events occur, and otherwise receive guidance from the premonition long after you\u2019ve forgotten it.\n\n**Choose Your Destiny**\n\nWhile attuned to the Veil of Fate you are keenly aware of your own destiny. \n\nWhen you spend 8 hours meditating on your destiny and life\u2019s purpose, you can see some of the steps you must take to change it. This meditation brings on a profound change, and when it is concluded you may choose a new _Destiny_ .\n\n**Control Fate**\n\nWhen you finish a long rest, you are bolstered by a strange sense of how to get the most out of your interactions and endeavours, gaining inspiration.\n\nIn addition, after completing a long rest you roll a d20\\. This is your foretelling roll. When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an ability check, _attack roll_ , or _saving throw_ , you may choose to replace the d20 roll with your foretelling roll. You may choose to use this property after seeing the initial roll, but before any of the roll\u2019s effects occur. Once you have used this property, you cannot do so again until finishing a long rest.\n\n**Magic**\n\nYou may cast _augury_  at will while attuned to and wearing the _Veil of Fate_.\n\nTwice per _long rest_  you can cast one of the following spells without consuming material components or expending a spell slot: _arcane eye , clairvoyance , commune , divination_ .\n\nRoll a d20 after each _long rest_ . On an 18 or above, you gain the benefits of the __foresight_ spell.",

Any knowledgeable scholar knows there is good reason for the practice\u2014sometimes when left idle for too long without a master the hut walks of its own accord directly towards the nearest planar portal, and all those known to have claimed ownership have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. \n\nA simple bed and table permanently affixed to the floor in this shuttered wooden hut, and it is able to fit up to 12 Medium or smaller creatures inside.

Once the veil is seen through, there are 8 glowing runes on the table, each only half-illuminated. When you pass your hand over a rune, the energies inside respond and you can fully illuminate it or remove its glow entirely. When certain runes are illuminated, enormous chicken legs beneath the hut rise it up off of the ground. The _Chicken Hut_ is a Gargantuan object with an Armor Class of 21, a total of 320 hit points, Speed 50 ft. or swim 10 ft. (0 ft. if the legs aren\u2019t extended), and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage.\n\nThe hut floats on water. While the hut\u2019s door and window shutters are closed, the interior is airtight and watertight. The interior holds enough air for 60 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nYou can use an action to control the illumination of as many as two of the hut\u2019s runes, and a bonus action to control a third. After each use, a rune goes back to its neutral position. Each rune, from left to right, functions as shown in the Walking Chicken Hut Runes table.\n\nIf you are not attuned to any magic items and spend a week inside of the _Walking Chicken Hut_, you can attune to it.

The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.",

Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm.

Using arcanoplasm while creating a magic item reduces the cost of the new item by 10 percent per degree of rarity of the magic item that was distilled into the arcanoplasm.

When you consume a dose, your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are reduced by 1 each. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. You can consume up to three doses as part of casting a spell, and you can choose to affect your spell with one of the following options for each dose you consumed: - If the spell is of the abjuration school, increase the save DC by 2.\n- If the spell has more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, treat the spell's effects as if you had cast the spell at one slot level higher than the spell slot you used.\n- The spell is affected by one of the following metamagic options, even if you aren't a sorcerer: heightened, quickened, or subtle. A spell can't be affected by the same option more than once, though you can affect one spell with up to three different options. If you consume one or more doses without casting a spell, you can choose to instead affect a spell you cast before you finish a long rest. In addition, consuming blue rose gives you some protection against spells. When a spellcaster you can see casts a spell, you can use your reaction to cause one of the following:\n- You have advantage on the saving throw against the spell if it is a spell of the abjuration school.\n- If the spell is counterspell or dispel magic, the DC increases by 2 to interrupt your spellcasting or to end a magic effect on you. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to the number of doses you consumed. At the end of each long rest, you must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, your Hit Dice maximum is reduced by 25 percent. This reduction affects only the number of Hit Dice you can use to regain hit points during a short rest; it doesn't reduce your hit point maximum. This reduction lasts until you recover from the addiction. If you have no remaining Hit Dice to lose, you suffer one level of exhaustion, and your Hit Dice are returned to 75 percent of your maximum Hit Dice. The process then repeats until you die from exhaustion or you recover from the addiction. On a successful save, your exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces your level of exhaustion below 1, you recover from the addiction. A greater restoration spell or similar magic ends the addiction and its effects.

      "desc": "This strange, twilight-hued tome was written on pages of pure shadow weave, bound in traditional birch board covers wrapped with shadow goblin hide, and imbued with the memories of forests on the Plane of Shadow. Its covers often reflect light as if it were resting in a forest grove, and some owners swear that a goblin face appears on them now and again. The sturdy lock on one side opens only for wizards, elves, and Shadow Fey (see Tome of Beasts). The book has 15 charges, and it regains 2d6 + 3 expended charges daily in the twilight before dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the book retains its Ebon Tides and Shadow Lore properties but loses its Spells property. When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in Deep Magic for 5th Edition.

The staff transforms into one of three wireframe creatures, depending on the command word: a unicorn, a hound, or a swarm of tiny beetles. The wireframe creature or swarm is under your control and acts on its own initiative count. On your turn, you can mentally command the wireframe creature or swarm if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren't incapacitated. You decide what action the creature takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. The wireframe unicorn lasts for up to 1 hour, uses the statistics of a warhorse, and can be used as a mount. The wireframe hound lasts for up to 5 minutes, uses the statistics of a dire wolf, and has advantage to track any creature you damaged within the past hour. The wireframe beetle swarm lasts for up to 1 minute, uses the statistics of a swarm of beetles, and can destroy nonmagical objects that aren't being worn or carried and that aren't made of stone or metal (destruction happens at a rate of 1 pound of material per round, up to a maximum of 10 pounds). At the end of the duration, the wireframe creature or swarm reverts to its staff form. It reverts to its staff form early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. If it reverts to its staff form early by being reduced to 0 hit points, the staff becomes inert and unusable until the third dawn after the creature was killed. Otherwise, the wireframe creature or swarm has all of its hit points when you transform the staff into the creature again.

Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.",

      "desc": "A figurehead of prowess must be mounted on the bow of a ship for its magic to take effect. While mounted on a ship, the figurehead\u2019s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead\u2019s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the \u201cpilot,\u201d and must use an action to speak the figurehead\u2019s command word. \nAlbatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator\u2019s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship\u2019s pilot doesn\u2019t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot\u2019s vision. \nBasilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s AC increases by 2. \nDragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship\u2019s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn\u2019t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5. \nKraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship\u2019s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship\u2019s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nManta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship\u2019s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it. \nNarwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check. \nOctopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nSphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn\u2019t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nXorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn\u2019t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour burrowing, the figurehead\u2019s magic ceases to function until the next dawn.",

When a humanoid dies aboard the vessel, it rises 1 minute later as a ghoul under the ship captain\u2019s control. A ghoul retains any knowledge of sailing or maintaining a waterborne vehicle that it had in life. \nCursed Captain. If the ship flying this flag doesn\u2019t have a captain, the undead crew seeks out a powerful humanoid or intelligent undead to bring aboard and coerce into becoming the captain. When an undead with an Intelligence of 10 or higher boards the captainless vehicle, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become magically bound to the ship and the flag. If the creature exits the vessel and boards it again, the creature must repeat the saving throw. The flag fills the captain with the desire to attack other vessels to grow its crew and commandeer larger vessels when possible, bringing the flag with it. If the flag is destroyed or removed from a waterborne vehicle for at least 7 days, the zombie and ghoul crew crumbles to dust, and the captain is freed of the flag\u2019s magic, if the captain was bound to it. \nUnholy Vessel. While aboard a vessel flying this flag, an undead creature has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead, and if it fails the saving throw, it isn\u2019t destroyed, no matter its CR. In addition, the captain and crew can\u2019t be frightened while aboard a vessel flying this flag. \nWhen a creature that isn\u2019t a construct or undead and isn\u2019t part of the crew boards the vessel, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned while it remains on board.

Most effects can be removed by dispel magic, greater restoration, or more powerful magic. | d10 | Frungilator Effect |\n| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| 1 | Glittering sparkles fly all around. You are surrounded in sparkling light until the end of your next turn as if you were targeted by the faerie fire spell. |\n| 2 | The target is encased in void crystal and immediately begins suffocating. A creature, including the target, can take its action to shatter the void crystal by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Alternatively, the void crystal can be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; hp 4; immunity to poison and psychic damage). |\n| 3 | Crimson void fire engulfs the target. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |\n| 4 | The target's blood turns to ice. It must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |\n| 5 | The target rises vertically to a height of your choice, up to a maximum height of 60 feet. The target remains suspended there until the start of its next turn. When this effect ends, the target floats gently to the ground. |\n| 6 | The target begins speaking in backwards fey speech for 10 minutes. While speaking this way, the target can't verbally communicate with creatures that aren't fey, and the target can't cast spells with verbal components. |\n| 7 | Golden flowers bloom across the target's body. It is blinded until the end of its next turn. |\n| 8 | The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it and all its equipment assumes a gaseous form until the end of its next turn. This effect otherwise works like the gaseous form spell. |\n| 9 | The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enthralled with its own feet or limbs until the end of its next turn. While enthralled, the target is incapacitated. |\n| 10 | A giant ray of force springs out of the frungilator and toward the target. Each creature in a line that is 5 feet wide between you and the target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |",

A small pool of clean, cool water rests at the base of a fourth wall post. The trees and the pool of water provide enough food and water for up to 10 people.

Justicars are arbiters of law and order, operating independently of any official city guard or watch divisions. They are recognizable by their black, hooded robes, silver masks, and the rods they carry as weapons. These stern sentinels are overseen by The Magister, a powerful wizard of whom little is known other than their title. The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together. The combined powers of this trinity of items make a Justicar a formidable force in the pursuit of law and order.",

It won\u2019t move into any obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move out of the bright light. In addition, each non-undead creature in the bright light can\u2019t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by an undead creature.\n Red Dragon\u2019s Breath (Very Rare).

The dragon's name was lost, but its legacy remains. This magic amulet is one of two items that were crafted to hold its heart. An intricate engraving of a warrior's sword piercing a dragon's chest is detailed along the front of this untarnished silver locket. Within the locket is a clear crystal vial with a pulsing piece of a dragon's heart. The pulses become more frequent when you are close to death. Attuning to the locket requires you to mix your blood with the blood within the vial. The vial holds 3 charges of dragon blood that are automatically expended when you reach certain health thresholds. The locket regains 1 expended charge for each vial of dragon blood you place in the vial inside the locket up to a maximum of 3 charges. For the purpose of this locket, \u201cdragon\u201d refers to any creature with the dragon type, including drakes and wyverns. While wearing or carrying the locket, you gain the following effects: - When you reach 0 hit points, but do not die outright, the vial breaks and the dragon heart stops pulsing, rendering the item broken and irreparable. You immediately gain temporary hit points equal to your level + your Constitution modifier. If the locket has at least 1 charge of dragon blood, it does not break, but this effect can't be activated again until 3 days have passed. - When you are reduced to half of your maximum hit points, the locket expends 1 charge of dragon blood, and you become immune to any type of blood loss effect, such as the blood loss from a stirge's Blood Drain, for 1d4 + 1 hours. Any existing blood loss effects end immediately when this activates.",

While wearing it, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. In addition, you can use an action to summon a cave bear (use the statistics of a brown bear) to serve you in battle. The bear is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn.

While wearing it, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, drag, or push. In addition, you can use an action to trumpet like a mammoth. Choose up to six creatures within 30 feet of you and that can hear the trumpet. For 1 minute, each target is under the effect of the bane (if a hostile creature; save DC 13) or bless (if a friendly creature) spell (no concentration required).

Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as \u201cthe person who blinded Lars Gustafson\u201d isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target.

A creature remains attuned to the mirror as long as it is on the same plane of existence as the mirror or until it chooses to end its attunement to the mirror during a short rest. Phase mirrors look almost identical to standard mirrors, but their surfaces are slightly clouded. These mirrors are found in a variety of sizes, from handheld to massive disks. The larger the mirror, the more power it can take in, and consequently, the more creatures it can affect. When it is created, a mirror is connected to a specific plane. The mirror draws in starlight and uses that energy to move between its current plane and its connected plane. While holding or touching a fully charged mirror, an attuned creature can use an action to speak the command word and activate the mirror. When activated, the mirror transports all creatures attuned to it to the mirror's connected plane or back to the Material Plane at a destination of the activating creature's choice. This effect works like the plane shift spell, except it transports only attuned creatures, regardless of their distance from each other, and the destination must be on the Material Plane or the mirror's connected plane. If the mirror is broken, its magic ends, and each attuned creature is trapped in whatever plane it occupies when the mirror breaks. Once activated, the mirror stays active for 24 hours and any attuned creature can use an action to transport all attuned creatures back and forth between the two planes. After these 24 hours have passed, the power drains from the mirror, and it can't be activated again until it is recharged.

The Magister has made it their duty to oversee order in the city and executes their plans through the Justicars, giving them the Magister's mark, a signet ring, as a symbol of their authority. While some officers and members of the watch may be resentful of the Justicars' presence, many are grateful for their aid, especially in situations that could require magic. Justicar's are a small, elite group, typically acting as solo agents, though extremely dangerous situations bring them together in pairs or larger groups as needed. The Justicars are outfitted with three symbols of authority that are also imbued with power: their masks, rods, and rings. Each by itself is a useful item, but they are made stronger when worn together. The combined powers of this trinity of items make a Justicar a formidable force in the pursuit of law and order.",

      "desc": "Crafted to serve in place of the dead in the afterlife, shabti are often used by the living for their own ends. These 1-foot-tall statuettes are crafted of ceramic, stone, or terracotta and are garbed in gear indicative of their function. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the shabti to a point on the ground within 30 feet of you, it grows into a Medium construct that performs the tasks for which it was created. If the space where the shabti would grow is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u2019t enough space for the shabti, the shabti doesn\u2019t grow. Unless stated otherwise in an individual shabti\u2019s description, a servile shabti uses the statistics of animated armor, except the servile shabti\u2019s Armor Class is 13, and it doesn\u2019t have the Multiattack or Slam actions. When the shabti is motionless, it is indistinguishable from a ceramic, stone, or terracotta statue, rather than a suit of armor. The shabti is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts immediately after you. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands (no action required by you unless specified in the shabti\u2019s description). If you issue no commands, the shabti takes the Dodge action and no other actions. The shabti exists for a duration specific to each shabti. At the end of the duration, it reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a statuette early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the shabti becomes a statuette again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the shabti\u2019s description. Crafter Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti wears a leather apron and carries the tools of its trade. Each crafting shabti is skilled in a single craft\u2014 weaponsmithing, pottery, carpentry, or another trade\u2014and has proficiency with the appropriate artisan\u2019s tools. You can use an action to command the shabti to craft a single, nonmagical item within its skill set, so long as you provide it the raw materials to do so. The shabti works at incredible speeds, needing only 10 minutes per 100 gp value of the item to finish its task. A crafting shabti can never create magic items. Once it completes its task, the shabti reverts to statuette form, and it can\u2019t be used again until a number of hours have passed equal to twice the market value in gold pieces of the item crafted (minimum of 10 hours). Defender Shabti (Uncommon). This shabti carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. You can use a bonus action to command the shabti to either defend you or harass an enemy you can see within 30 feet of you. If the shabti defends you, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has disadvantage on melee weapon attack rolls against you. If the shabti harasses a creature, each creature within 5 feet of the shabti has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls against that creature. The shabti remains active for up to 8 hours, after which it reverts to statuette form and can\u2019t be used again until 3 days have passed. Digger Shabti (Uncommon). The shabti carries a shovel and pick. You can command the shabti to excavate earthworks to your specifications. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of earth or mud in any fashion (digging a hole or trench, raising a rampart, or similar), which takes 1 minute to complete. The shabti can manipulate a 10-foot cube of stone in a similar fashion, but it takes 10 minutes to complete. The shabti can work for up to 1 hour before reverting to statuette form. Once used, the shabti can\u2019t be used again until 2 days have passed. Farmer Shabti (Rare). This shabti carries farming implements. If you activate it in an area with sufficient soil and a climate suitable for growing crops, the shabti begins tilling the earth and planting seeds it carries, which are magically replenished during its time in statuette form. The shabti tends its field, magically bringing the crops to full growth and harvesting them in a period of 8 hours. The yield from the harvest is enough to feed up to twelve creatures for 7 days, and the crops remain edible for 30 days before perishing. Alternately, the shabti can spend 10 minutes planting magical crops. The magical crops take 30 minutes to grow and harvest and 30 minutes to consume. Up to twelve creatures can consume the magical crops, gaining benefits as if partaking in a heroes' feast. The benefits don\u2019t set in until 30 minutes after the crops were harvested, and any uneaten crops disappear at that time. Once the shabti is used to perform either function, the shabti returns to statuette form, and it can\u2019t be used again until 30 days have passed. Healer Shabti (Very Rare). This shabti is dressed in scholarly robes and carries a bag of medical supplies. It is proficient with a healer\u2019s kit, has Medicine +7, and tends to the wounds of you and your companions. If directed to administer care when you take a short rest, the shabti can tend the wounds of up to six creatures over the course of the hour. Each creature that spends Hit Dice to regain hit points during that short rest increases the amount gained per Hit Die by 2, up to the maximum number that can be rolled. The shabti follows you and tends to the wounds of you and your companions, as directed, for up to 8 hours before reverting to statuette form. While the shabti is active, you can use a bonus action to command it to cast cure wounds (4th-level version), lesser restoration, or protection from poison on one creature you can see within 30 feet of you on its next turn. The shabti can cast each spell only once. When it has cast all three spells, the shabti reverts to statuette form, even if its normal duration hasn\u2019t ended. Once the shabti has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed. Warrior Shabti (Rare). This shabti wields a spear and carries a shield, increasing its AC by 2. This shabti has the animated armor\u2019s Multiattack and Slam actions, except the shabti\u2019s Slam attack deals piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the animated armor\u2019s Slam attack. This shabti can understand and carry out fairly complex commands, such as standing watch while you and your companions rest or guarding a room and letting only specific creatures in or out. The shabti follows you and acts as directed for up to 8 hours or until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it returns to statuette form. Once the shabti has been used, it can\u2019t be used again until 5 days have passed.",

The coat can hold up to 40 pounds of material in up to 10 different extradimensional pockets. Nothing can be placed inside the coat that won't fit in a pocket. Retrieving an item from a pocket requires you to use an action. When you reach into the coat for a specific item, the correct pocket always appears with the desired item magically on top. As a bonus action, you can force the pockets to become visible on the coat. While you maintain concentration, the coat displays its four outer pockets, two on each side, four inner pockets, and two pockets on each sleeve. While the pockets are visible, any creature you allow can store or retrieve an item as an action. If the coat is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. Placing the coat inside an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding, instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

The raven's talons, perched on a branch, serve as the chalice's base. A pair of interlocking gold rings adorn the sides of the bowl. As a 1-minute ritual, you and another creature that isn't a construct or undead and that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher can fill the chalice with wine and mix in three drops of blood from each of you. You and the other participant can then drink from the chalice, mingling your spirits and creating a magical connection between you.

The bond lasts until one or both of you end it of your own free will (no action required), one or both of you use the chalice to bond with another creature, or one of you dies. You and your bonded partner each gain the following benefits: - You are proficient in each saving throw that your bonded partner is proficient in.\n- If you are within 5 feet of your bonded partner and you fail a saving throw, your bonded partner can make the saving throw as well. If your bonded partner succeeds, you can choose to succeed on the saving throw that you failed.\n- You can use a bonus action to concentrate on the magical bond between you to determine your bonded partner's status. You become aware of the direction and distance to your bonded partner, whether they are unharmed or wounded, any conditions that may be currently affecting them, and whether or not they are afflicted with an addiction, curse, or disease. If you can see your bonded partner, you automatically know this information just by looking at them.\n- If your bonded partner is wounded, you can use a bonus action to take 4d8 slashing damage, healing your bonded partner for the same amount. If your bonded partner is reduced to 0 hit points, you can do this as a reaction.\n- If you are under the effects of a spell that has a duration but doesn't require concentration, you can use an action to touch your bonded partner to share the effects of the spell with them, splitting the remaining duration (rounded down) between you. For example, if you are affected by the mage armor spell and it has 4 hours remaining, you can use an action to touch your bonded partner to give them the benefits of the mage armor spell, reducing the duration to 2 hours on each of you.\n- If your bonded partner dies, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you drop to 0 hit points. On a success, you are stunned until the end of your next turn by the shock of the bond suddenly being broken.

Whenever you are immersed in a body of water while holding this shield, you can use a reaction to envelop yourself in a 10-foot radius bubble of fresh air. This bubble floats in place, but you can move it up to 30 feet during your turn. You are moved with the bubble when it moves. The air within the bubble magically replenishes itself every round and prevents foreign particles, such as poison gases and water-borne parasites, from entering the area. Other creatures can leave or enter the bubble freely, but it collapses as soon as you exit it. The exterior of the bubble is immune to damage and creatures making ranged attacks against anyone inside the bubble have disadvantage on their attack rolls. The bubble lasts for 1 minute or until you exit it. Once used, this property can\u2019t be used again until the next dawn. Sanctuary. You can use a bonus action to cast the sanctuary spell (save DC 13) from the shield. This spell protects you from only water elementals and other creatures composed of water.

Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\n\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.\n\n| Playing Card      | Illusion                         |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Ace of hearts     | Red dragon                       |\n| King of hearts    | Knight and four guards           |\n| Queen of hearts   | Succubus or incubus              |\n| Jack of hearts    | Druid                            |\n| Ten of hearts     | Cloud giant                      |\n| Nine of hearts    | Ettin                            |\n| Eight of hearts   | Bugbear                          |\n| Two of hearts     | Goblin                           |\n| Ace of diamonds   | Beholder                         |\n| King of diamonds  | Archmage and mage apprentice     |\n| Queen of diamonds | Night hag                        |\n| Jack of diamonds  | Assassin                         |\n| Ten of diamonds   | Fire giant                       |\n| Nine of diamonds  | Ogre mage                        |\n| Eight of diamonds | Gnoll                            |\n| Two of diamonds   | Kobold                           |\n| Ace of spades     | Lich                             |\n| King of spades    | Priest and two acolytes          |\n| Queen of spades   | Medusa                           |\n| Jack of spades    | Veteran                          |\n| Ten of spades     | Frost giant                      |\n| Nine of spades    | Troll                            |\n| Eight of spades   | Hobgoblin                        |\n| Two of spades     | Goblin                           |\n| Ace of clubs      | Iron golem                       |\n| King of clubs     | Bandit captain and three bandits |\n| Queen of clubs    | Erinyes                          |\n| Jack of clubs     | Berserker                        |\n| Ten of clubs      | Hill giant                       |\n| Nine of clubs     | Ogre                             |\n| Eight of clubs    | Orc                              |\n| Two of clubs      | Kobold                           |\n| Jokers (2)        | You (the deck's owner)           |",

      "desc": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\n| Playing Card       | Card        |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Ace of diamonds    | Vizier\\*    |\n| King of diamonds   | Sun         |\n| Queen of diamonds  | Moon        |\n| Jack of diamonds   | Star        |\n| Two of diamonds    | Comet\\*     |\n| Ace of hearts      | The Fates\\* |\n| King of hearts     | Throne      |\n| Queen of hearts    | Key         |\n| Jack of hearts     | Knight      |\n| Two of hearts      | Gem\\*       |\n| Ace of clubs       | Talons\\*    |\n| King of clubs      | The Void    |\n| Queen of clubs     | Flames      |\n| Jack of clubs      | Skull       |\n| Two of clubs       | Idiot\\*     |\n| Ace of spades      | Donjon\\*    |\n| King of spades     | Ruin        |\n| Queen of spades    | Euryale     |\n| Jack of spades     | Rogue       |\n| Two of spades      | Balance\\*   |\n| Joker (with TM)    | Fool\\*      |\n| Joker (without TM) | Jester      |\n\n\\*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\n\n**_Balance_**. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\n**_Comet_**. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\n**_Donjon_**. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a _wish_ spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\n**_Euryale_**. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\n**_The Fates_**. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\n**_Flames_**. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\n**_Fool_**. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\n**_Gem_**. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\n**_Idiot_**. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Jester_**. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\n**_Key_**. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\n\n**_Knight_**. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\n**_Moon_**. You are granted the ability to cast the _wish_ spell 1d3 times.\n\n**_Rogue_**. A nonplayer character of the GM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\n**_Ruin_**. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\n**_Skull_**. You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life.\n\n**_Star_**. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\n**_Sun_**. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\n**_Talons_**. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\n**_Throne_**. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\n**_Vizier_**. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\n**_The Void_**. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. \n\n",

You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\n\n**_Bird_**. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\n\n**_Fan_**. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\n\n**_Swan Boat_**. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot* wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees.

The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\n\n**_Tree_**. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\n\n**_Whip_**. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.",

      "desc": "A _figurine of wondrous power_ is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.\n\n**_Bronze Griffon (Rare)_**. This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\n**_Ebony Fly (Rare)_**. This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed.\n\n> ##### Giant Fly\n> **Armor Class** 11  \n> **Hit Points** 19 (3d10 + 3)  \n> **Speed** 30 ft., fly 60 ft.\n>\n> | STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT    | WIS     | CHA    |\n> |---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|\n> | 14 (+2) | 13 (+1) | 13 (+1) | 2 (-4) | 10 (+0) | 3 (-4) |\n>\n> **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10  \n> **Languages** -\n\n**_Golden Lions (Rare)_**. These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Ivory Goats (Rare)_**. These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n* The _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n* The _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n* The _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a _+1 lance_, and the other becomes a _+2 longsword_. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.\n\n**_Marble Elephant (Rare)_**. This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Obsidian Steed (Very Rare)_**. This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed.\n\nIf you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\n\n**_Onyx Dog (Rare)_**. This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\n**_Serpentine Owl (Rare)_**. This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.\n\n**_Silver Raven (Uncommon)_**. This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the _animal messenger_ spell on it at will.",

If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a _bag of holding_, _portable hole_, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

      "desc": "Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts _suggestion_ on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\n\n**_Random Properties_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ has the following random properties:\n\n* 2 minor beneficial properties\n* 1 minor detrimental property\n* 1 major detrimental property\n\n**_Spells_**. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: _cure wounds_ (5th-level version, 3 charges), _daylight_ (1 charge), _death ward_ (2 charges), or _scrying_ (3 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast the _detect magic_ spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\n**_Call Dragons_**. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\n**_Destroying an Orb_**. An _Orb of Dragonkind_ appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A _disintegrate_ spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\n\n**_Six Buttons_**. You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a _flame tongue_, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.\n\nIf you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n\nIf you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\n\n**_Drain Life_**. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\n**_Paralyze_**. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\n**_Terrify_**. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.",

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.\n\n**_Thunder_**.

You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long.

The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action. Swan Boat (Rare).

You can then take a Bonus Action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows: Goat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance, and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat, any Hostile creature that starts its turn within a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed. Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all expended charges. Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed. Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5 days have passed. The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form. Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours.

      "name": "Ioun Stone",
      "desc": "Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones orbiting your head at the same time. Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it. As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it's orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had dropped it. The type of stone determines its rarity and effects. Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere orbits your head. Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks. Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head. Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses its magic. Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head. Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head. Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head. Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head. Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit Points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit Point. Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM. Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses. While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space. Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head. Sustenance (Rare). You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.",

The creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour, understanding those commands even if it doesn't know the language in which the commands are given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action and use a command word to activate it. It remains activated until you take a Magic action and repeat the command word to deactivate it. Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the mirror's nature makes the save with Advantage, and Constructs succeed on the save automatically. An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate. In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and use a second command word to free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it. Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane.

Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect. Comet. The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect. Donjon.

Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. Euryale. The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a \u22122 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse. Fates. Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.

You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws. Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet. Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The GM chooses the weapon. Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired. Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times. Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Rogue. An NPC of the GM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Sage. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life. Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24. Sun. A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die. Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead. Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours. Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards. > ### Avatar of Death > > Medium Undead, Neutral evil > > AC 20 > > Initiative +3 (13) > > HP Half the HP maximum of its summoner > > Speed 60 ft., Fly 60 ft.

You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form: Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.

Button 2.

Button 3. The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. Drain Life.

On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere.

While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet).

You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it. Ultimate End. The talisman has 6 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.",
