### Special Abilities

- **Regeneration:** The trollkin shaman regains 5 hp at the start of its turn. If the shaman takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the shaman's next turn. The shaman dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.
- **Thick Hide:** The trollkin shaman's skin is thick and tough, granting it a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus is already factored into the trollkin's AC.
- **Spellcasting:** The trollkin shaman is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will): druidcraft, produce flame, shillelagh
1st level (4 slots): cure wounds, entangle, faerie fire, thunderwave
2nd level (3 slots): flaming sphere, hold person
3rd level (3 slots): dispel magic, meld into stone, sleet storm
