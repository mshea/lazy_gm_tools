- **Immutable Form:** The paper golem swarm is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Ink Blot (Recharge 4-6):** As a bonus action, the paper golem applies ink to itself. The next time it hits a creature with a paper cut attack or whirlwind action, the creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Magic Weapons:** The paper golem's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and it can move through any opening large enough for a piece of paper. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Paper Cut:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) slashing damage, or 7 (2d6) slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.
- **Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6):** The air is momentarily filled with paper golems. Each creature within 5 feet of the swarm must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
