### Special Abilities

- **Master of Disguise:** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses its stench.
- **Shadow Stealth:** While in dim light or darkness, the darakhul shadowmancer can take the Hide action as a bonus action.
- **Stench:** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the darakhul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the darakhul's Stench for the next 24 hours. A darakhul shadowmancer using this ability can't also benefit from Master of Disguise.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the darakhul has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Turning Defiance:** The darakhul shadowmancer and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Spellcasting:** The darakhul shadowmancer is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following wizard spells prepared: 
Cantrips (at will): acid splash, chill touch, mage hand, prestidigitation

2nd level (3 slots): misty step, scorching ray, see invisibility
