### Special Abilities

- **Sand Camouflage (Sand Form Only):** The fragrite has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy terrain.
- **Sand Glide (Sand Form Only):** The fragrite can burrow through sand without disturbing the material it moves through.
- **Shapechanger:** As a bonus action, the fragrite can polymorph into a mass of sand or a glass humanoid. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. 

While in sand form, the fragrite has a burrow speed of 50 feet, it can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and it is immune to the grappled condition. While in glass form, the fragrite has vulnerability to thunder damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fragrite makes two strike attacks.
- **Strike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the fragrite is in its glass form and has less than half of its total hp remaining, this attack instead deals 16 (3d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Spontaneous Explosion (Glass Form Only; Recharge 5-6):** The fragrite explodes into shards of glass, reducing its hp by 5 (2d4). Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fragrite then polymorphs into its sand form.
