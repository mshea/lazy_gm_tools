### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The bathhouse drake can breathe air and water.
- **Soapy:** The bathhouse drake has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The bathhouse drake's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: create or destroy water, misty step, prestidigitation
3/day each: control water, fog cloud, gaseous form, lesser restoration

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The bathhouse drake makes three melee attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use Scalding Jet twice.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Scalding Jet:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Steam Burst (Recharge 5-6):** The bathhouse drake creates a burst of hot steam. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage but isn't blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
