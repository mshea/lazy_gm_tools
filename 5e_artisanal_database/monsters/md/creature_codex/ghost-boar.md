### Special Abilities

- **Charge:** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Incorporeal Jaunt:** When the ghost boar moves, it becomes temporarily incorporeal. It can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is pushed to the closest unoccupied space if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the boar takes 15 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.

### Actions

- **Tusk:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

### Reactions

- **Tusk Swipe:** When a creature hits the ghost boar with a melee weapon attack, the ghost boar can make one tusk attack against the creature. The ghost boar must see the attacker and be within 5 feet of it.
