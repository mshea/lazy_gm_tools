### Special Abilities

- **Fear Aura:** Any non-evil creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the doom golem must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, unless the doom golem is incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the doom golem's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.
- **Luminous Skeleton:** The doom golem sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The doom golem makes one bite attack and one doom claw attack.
- **Doom Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage.
- **Wind of Boreas (Recharge 5-6):** The doom golem releases an arctic wind in a 15-foot radius around itself or in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 38 (11d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Doom Upon You:** When a creature the doom golem can see within 60 feet of it hits it with a spell or attack that requires a ranged attack roll, the doom golem strikes the attacker with a doom bolt. The doom bolt is a shadowy reflection of the original attack, using the same attack roll and effects as the original, except it deals necrotic damage.
