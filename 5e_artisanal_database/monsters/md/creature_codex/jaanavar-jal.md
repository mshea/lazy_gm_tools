### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The jaanavar jal can breathe air and water.
- **Regeneration:** The jaanavar jal regains 10 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp. If the jaanavar jal takes cold damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The jaanavar jal dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The jaanavar jal makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained and the jaanavar jal can't constrict another creature.
- **Flaming Oil Spittle (Recharge 5-6):** The jaanavar jal expels a line of burning oil that is 40 feet long and 5 feet wide from glands beside its mouth. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
