### Special Abilities

- **Absorbent:** When the avatar damages a creature, it absorbs a portion of that creature's knowledge and power. As a bonus action, it can recreate any action available to a creature it damaged within the last minute. This includes spells and actions with limited uses or with a recharge. This recreated action is resolved using the avatar's statistics where applicable.
- **Amorphous:** The avatar, including its equipment, can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the avatar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- **Soothing Aura:** Any creature hostile to the avatar that starts its turn within 30 feet of the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn. Creatures with Intelligence 3 or lower automatically fail the saving throw.
- **Innate Spellcasting (Psionics):** The avatar's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell casting DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). It may cast the following spells innately, requiring no components:
At will: acid splash (4d6), light, spare the dying, true strike
3/day each: bless, blur, command, darkness, enthrall, shield
2/day each: counterspell, dispel magic
1/day each: black tentacles, confusion

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The avatar makes three oozing tentacle attacks.
- **Oozing Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (4d12 + 5) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) acid damage.
- **Legendary Merge:** A shoth with less than half its maximum hp can merge with any other shoth creature within 10 feet, adding its remaining hp to that creature's. The hp gained this way can exceed the normal maximum of that creature. The avatar can accept any number of such mergers.
- **Acid Wave (Recharge 5-6):** The avatar rises up and crashes down, releasing a 20-foot radius wave of acidic ooze. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 67 (15d8) acid damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
- **Consult the Zom (1/Day):** The avatar uses its action to consult its weighty zom for insight. The zom flashes brilliant crimson-and-white light. Each creature within 120 feet who can see the avatar must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Each creature of the avatar's choice within 120 feet that speaks a language must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn as the avatar telepathically utters a short expression that is particularly meaningful to that creature.

The avatar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The avatar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **At Will Spell:** The avatar casts one at will spell.
- **Oozing Tentacle:** The avatar makes one oozing tentacle attack.
