- **Fractalize:** When the golem is reduced to 0 hp, it explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of it, except for other fractal golems, must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (1d8) force damage and be pushed back 5 feet. Two duplicate fractal golems appear in the golem's space and the nearest unoccupied space, each with the same statistics as the original fractal golem, except one size smaller. When a Tiny duplicate of the golem is reduced to 0 hp, it explodes and doesn't duplicate. All duplicates act on the same initiative.

- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.
