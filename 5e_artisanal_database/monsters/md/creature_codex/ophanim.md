- **Holy Fire (Recharge 5-6):** The ophanim emits a burst of holy fire. Each creature within 30 feet of the ophanim must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hp by this damage dies, leaving only a pile of fine ash.
