### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The fulminar doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Essence of Lightning:** Bolts of lightning course around the fulminar's body, shedding bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The fulminar can alter the radius as a bonus action.
- **Lightning Form:** The fulminar can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the fulminar or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fulminar makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) lightning damage and the target can't take reactions until the end of the fulminar's next turn.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage and 7 (2d6) lightning damage.
- **Lightning Shackles (Recharge 5-6):** The fulminar magically creates three sets of shackles of lightning, each of which can strike a creature the fulminar can see within 60 feet of it. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 18 (4d8) lightning damage and is restrained for 1 minute. On a success, the target takes half the damage but isn't restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
