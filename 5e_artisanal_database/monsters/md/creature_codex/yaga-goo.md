### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The goo can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Deadly to Fey:** The goo has advantage on attack rolls against fey and any creature with the Fey Ancestry trait.
- **Spider Climb:** The goo can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The Yaga goo makes two pseudopod attacks. When its Foul Transit is available, it can use Foul Transit in place of one pseudopod attack.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) necrotic damage.
- **Foul Transit (Recharge 4-6):** The goo teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 50 feet, leaving behind a wretched puddle in the space it previously occupied. A creature within 5 feet of the space the goo left must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. The first time a creature enters the puddle's space or if a creature starts its turn in the puddle's space it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and is poisoned. The puddle lasts for 1 minute or until the goo that created it is killed.

### Reactions

- **Puddle Splash:** When a creature the Yaga goo can see targets it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of the goo, the goo can teleport to a puddle created by its Foul Transit, if that puddle's space is unoccupied, negating the damage from the attack. If it does, the attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
