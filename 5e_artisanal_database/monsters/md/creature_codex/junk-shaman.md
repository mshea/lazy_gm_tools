### Special Abilities

- **Animate Objects (1/Day):** The kobold casts animate objects without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.
- **Junk Armor:** As a bonus action, the kobold can create magical armor out of scrap metal and bits of junk it touches. The armor provides AC 13 + Dexterity modifier, and a critical hit scored against the kobold becomes a normal hit instead. The armor lasts until the kobold uses a bonus action to end it, the armor is removed from the kobold, or the kobold dies.
- **Pack Tactics:** The kobold has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The kobold junk shaman makes two junk staff attacks.
- **Junk Staff:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Flame Jet:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
