### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Seeping Death:** A living creature that touches the ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by 1d4. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies and its body becomes a suppurating ooze 1d4 hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the lesser restoration spell or other similar magic.
- **Spider Climb:** The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the seeping death disease (see the Seeping Death trait).
