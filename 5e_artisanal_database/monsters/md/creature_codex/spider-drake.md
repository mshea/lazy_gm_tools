### Special Abilities

- **Sticky Secretions:** When the spider drake is hit with a melee attack, the attacker's weapon becomes stuck to the web fluid secreted from its scales. If the attacker didn't use a weapon, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained in the webbing. As an action, a creature can make a DC 16 Strength check, escaping or freeing its weapon from the secretions on a success.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spider drake makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can use Web in place of its bite attack.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The drake exhales poisonous gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 42 (12d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Web (Recharge 5-6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The creature is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 16 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect also ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
