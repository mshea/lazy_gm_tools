### Special Abilities

- **Assassinate:** During its first turn, the shadow fey has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the poisoner scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
- **Born of Shadows:** When in dim light or darkness, the shadow fey poisoner is invisible.
- **Evasion:** If the shadow fey poisoner is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the poisoner instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **Fey Ancestry:** The shadow fey has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.
- **Shadow Traveler (4/Day):** As a bonus action while in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this trait.
- **Sneak Attack (1/Turn):** The shadow fey poisoner deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll; or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the poisoner, that ally isn't incapacitated, and the poisoner doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Traveler in Darkness:** The shadow fey has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to know about shadow roads and shadow magic spells or items.

- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
