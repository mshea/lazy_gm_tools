- **Keen Smell:** The ursa polaris has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
- **Snow Camouflage:** The ursa polaris has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ursa polaris makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The ursa polaris exhales a blast of freezing wind and shards of ice in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage and 14 (4d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Hypnotic Array (Recharge 5-6):** The ursa polaris sways its back, causing the ice formations on its shoulders to catch available light. Each creature within 30 feet of the ursa polaris that sees the light pattern must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) radiant damage and is stunned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned. A stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends if the creature takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it out of its stupor.
