### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the quiet soul remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary humanoid corpse.
- **Melancholic Emanation:** The quiet soul emits a magical aura of lethargy and despondency. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the quiet soul must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.

### Actions

- **Psychic Lash:** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (6d6) psychic damage. If an unconscious creature is hit by this attack, that creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, remaining unconscious on a failed save, or waking on a successful one.
