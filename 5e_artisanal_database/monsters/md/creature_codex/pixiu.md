### Special Abilities

- **Consume Treasure:** The pixiu has an appetite for gold, silver, and jewels and consumes them whenever possible. If the pixiu attempts to eat a magical coin, gemstone, or piece of jewelry, the object has a 25% chance of breaking, dispelling its magic and rendering it useless. If the object doesn't break, the pixiu gives up trying to eat it.
