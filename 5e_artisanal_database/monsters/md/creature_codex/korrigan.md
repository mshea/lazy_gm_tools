### Special Abilities

- **Ungodly Resistance:** The korrigan has advantage on saving throws against spells or other magical effects cast or created by a cleric or paladin.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The korrigan's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The korrigan can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
3/day each: charm person, enthrall, hideous laughter, misty step
1/day: divination

### Actions

- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Deadly Breath (Recharge 4-6):** The korrigan targets one creature within 5 feet and exhales its foul breath. The creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Enchanting Revels (1/Day at Dusk or Night Only):** The korrigan sings a magical melody and dances. Each humanoid within 60 feet of the korrigan that can hear the revels must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the revels end. For every korrigan that joins in the revels, the save DC increases by 1 (maximum DC 19). <br><br>Each korrigan participating in the revels must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing and must use its move action to move at least 5 feet to continue dancing. It can keep singing and dancing for up to 1 minute as long as it maintains concentration. The song ends if all of the korrigan lose concentration or stop singing and dancing. <br><br>A charmed target is incapacitated and begins to dance and caper for the duration of the revels. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Enchanting Revels of the same band of korrigan for the next 24 hours.

### Reactions

- **Catch Me If You Can:** When a creature moves within 5 feet of the korrigan, the korrigan can cast the misty step spell.
