If the knight moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack  they deal an extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage  and the target makes a DC 14 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure. This attack is made at disadvantage against targets within 5 feet.

A creature can benefit from only one Knightly Inspiration at a time  and the knight cannot target themselves.
