### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Flowing Grace:** The dragon doesnt provoke opportunity attacks when it flies or swims out of an enemys reach.
- **Essence Link:** The essence dragon is spiritually linked to a specific area or landmark. The dragon gains no benefit from a long rest when more than 1 mile away from its linked area. If the dragon dies, the area it is linked to loses its vital essence until it forms a new essence dragon, which can take centuries. When a creature first enters an area that has lost its vital essence in this way, they gain a level of fatigue and a level of strife. This fatigue and strife can be removed only by completing a long rest outside the area.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d10 + 2) piercing damage.
- **Torrential Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales water in a 15-foot-long  5-foot-wide line. Each creature in the area makes a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw  taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
