### Special Abilities

- **Conductive:** Each time a creature touches the will-o-wisp or hits it with a metal melee weapon for the first time on a turn, the creature takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage. This trait doesnt function while the will-o-wisps glow is extinguished.
- **Insubstantial:** The will-o-wisp can't pick up or move objects or creatures. It can move through creatures and objects. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Treasure Sense:** The will-o-wisp knows the location of coins, gems, and other nonmagical wealth within 500 feet.
- **Undead Nature:** A will-o-wisp doesnt require air, sustenance, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Shock:** Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) lightning damage. The will-o-wisp can't make this attack while its glow is extinguished.

### Bonus Actions

- **Illumination:** The will-o-wisp alters the radius of its glow (shedding bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for the same number of feet beyond that radius), changes the color of its glow, or extinguishes its glow (making it invisible).
