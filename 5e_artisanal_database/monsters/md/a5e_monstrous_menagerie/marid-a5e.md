### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The marid can breathe air and water.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The marids innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: alter self (can assume Medium or Large form), create or destroy water, detect magic, purify food and drink, 3/day each: control water, creation, tongues, water breathing, water walk, 1/day each: conjure elemental (water elemental only), plane shift (to Elemental Plane of Water only)

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The marid makes two trident attacks. One of these can be replaced with a net attack.
- **Trident:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage. If thrown  the trident returns to the marids hand.
- **Net:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one target. Hit: A Large  Medium  or Small target is restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Strength check  freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net is an object with AC 10  20 hit points  vulnerability to slashing damage  and immunity to bludgeoning  poison  and psychic damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fog Cloud (1/Day):** The marid magically creates a heavily obscured area of fog (or, if underwater, inky water) in a 30-foot radius around a point it can see within 60 feet. The fog spreads around corners and can be dispersed by a moderate wind or current (at least 10 miles per hour). Otherwise, it disperses after 10 minutes. The marid can see through this fog.
- **Water Jet (While Bloodied):** The marid shoots water in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long jet. Each creature in the area makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 20 feet away from the marid, to a maximum of 60 feet away, and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half damage.
