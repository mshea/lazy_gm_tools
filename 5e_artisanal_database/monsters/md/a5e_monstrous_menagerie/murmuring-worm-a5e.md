### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The worm can breathe air and water.
- **Locate Mind:** The worm is aware of the location and relative intelligence of all creatures with Intelligence scores greater than 3 within 500 feet.
- **Maddening Murmurs:** The worm babbles constantly. A non-aberrant creature that starts its turn within 30 feet and can hear its murmurs makes a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is confused until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The worm constricts once and attacks once with its bite.
- **Constrict:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 17) and restrained while grappled.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is killed by this attack  the worm eats its head.

### Bonus Actions

- **Mental Summons:** One creature with an Intelligence score greater than 3 within 120 feet makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it uses its reaction to move up to its Speed towards the worm by the shortest route possible, avoiding hazards but not opportunity attacks. This is a magical charm effect.
