- **Relentless (1/Day):** If the wereboar takes 14 or less damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is instead reduced to 1 hit point.
- **Wolfsbane:** Lycanthropes are repelled by the wolfsbane flower. A lycanthrope in hybrid or beast form is poisoned while within 10 feet of a living or dried wolfsbane flower that it can smell. If wolfsbane is applied to a weapon or ammunition, lycanthropes are damaged by the weapon as if it were silver. An application of wolfsbane lasts for 1 hour.
