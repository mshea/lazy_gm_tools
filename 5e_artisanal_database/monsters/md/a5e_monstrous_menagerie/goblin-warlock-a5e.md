- **Clinging Illusion:** The warlock creates a magical illusion of an unmoving Medium or smaller object in a space it can see within 30 feet. The illusion can hide a smaller object in the same space. The illusion lasts 24 hours  until a creature touches it  or until the warlock uses Clinging Illusion again. A creature can take an action to make a DC 12 Investigation check to disbelieve the illusion. On a success  the illusion appears transparent to the creature.

### Reactions

- **Quick Switch:** When the warlock is hit by an attack, it magically teleports, switching places with a goblin ally within 30 feet. The goblin ally is hit by the triggering attack and suffers its effects.
