### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.

- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales a blast of fire that fills a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw  taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw also suffers 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. While affected by this ongoing damage  it is frightened of the dragon. A creature can use an action to end the ongoing damage.
