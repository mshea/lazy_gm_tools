### Special Abilities

- **Luring Scent:** When a beast, humanoid or fey creature begins its turn within 30 feet, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it moves as close as it can to the wallflower and ends its turn. Creatures immune to being charmed are immune to this effect. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Luring Scent of all wallflowers for 24 hours.

### Actions

### Bonus Actions

- **Beak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the grick. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.
