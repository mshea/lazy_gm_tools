### Special Abilities

- **Heated Body:** A creature that starts its turn grappled by the salamander, touches it, or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet takes 7 (2d6) fire damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. If the salamander has taken cold damage since the end of its last turn, this trait doesnt function.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The salamander makes a tail attack and a pike attack.
- **Tail:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage  the target is subjected to the salamanders Heated Body trait  and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends  the target is restrained  the salamander automatically hits the target with its tail attack  and the salamander can't attack a different target with its tail.
- **Pike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Fire Breath:** The salamander exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success.
