### Special Abilities

- **Fiery Aura:** A creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of one or more azers takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. The azer sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The azer attacks with its returning hammer and uses Bonfire if available.
- **Returning Hammer:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 feet  one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. The azers hammer returns to its hand after its thrown.
- **Bonfire (3/Day):** A 5-foot-square space within 60 feet catches fire. A creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there. A creature can use an action to extinguish this fire.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fire Step:** While standing in fire, the azer can magically teleport up to 90 feet to a space within fire.
