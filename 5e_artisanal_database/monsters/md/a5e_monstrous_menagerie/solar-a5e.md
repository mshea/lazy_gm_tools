### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The solar attacks twice with its holy sword.
- **Holy Sword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) radiant damage.
- **Column of Flame:** Flame erupts in a 10-foot-radius  30-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point the solar can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in the area makes a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw  taking 21 (6d6) fire damage and 21 (6d6) radiant damage of a failure  or half as much damage on a success.

### Reactions

- **Forceful Parry (While Bloodied):** When a creature misses the solar with a melee attack, the solars parrying sword sparks with energy. The attacker takes 21 (6d6) lightning damage and makes a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is pushed 10 feet away and falls prone.



### Legendary Actions

- **The solar can take 3 legendary actions:** Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. The solar regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
- **Teleport:** The solar magically teleports up to 120 feet to an empty space it can see.
- **Heal (3/Day):** The solar touches a creature other than itself, magically healing 60 hit points of damage and ending any blindness, curse, deafness, disease, or poison on the target.
- **Deafening Command (Costs 2 Actions):** The solar speaks an echoing command. Each creature of the solars choice within 30 feet that can hear the solar and understands a language makes a DC 24 Charisma saving throw. Each creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage. Each creature that fails its saving throw immediately takes a certain action, depending on the solars command. This is a magical charm effect.
