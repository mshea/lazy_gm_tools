### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hag attacks with its claws and uses Hex.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Hex (Gaze):** A creature within 60 feet that is not already under a hags hex makes a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. A creature under an obligation to the hag automatically fails this saving throw. On a failed saving throw  the target is cursed with a magical hex that lasts 30 days. The curse ends early if the target suffers harm from the hag or if the hag ends it as an action. Roll 1d4:
- **1:** Charm Hex. The target is charmed by the hag.
- **2:** Fear Hex. The target is frightened of the hag.
- **3:** Ill Fortune Hex. The hag magically divines the targets activities. Whenever the target attempts a long-duration task such as a craft or downtime activity  the hag can cause the activity to fail.
- **4:** Sleep Hex. The target falls unconscious. The curse ends early if the target takes damage or if a creature uses an action to shake it awake.
- **Invisibility (2nd-Level; V, S, Concentration):** The hag is invisible for 1 hour. The spell ends if the hag attacks  uses Hex  or casts a spell.
