If still restrained  the creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success  the effect ends. On a failure  the creature is petrified for 24 hours.

- **Frenzy (1/Day):** When attacked by a creature it can see within 20 feet, the cockatrice moves up to half its Speed and makes a bite attack against that creature.
