### Special Abilities

- **Chaotic Evil:** The glabrezu radiates a Chaotic and Evil aura.
- **Magic Resistance:** The glabrezu has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The glabrezu makes two pincer attacks.
- **Pincer:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature  it is grappled (escape DC 17). The glabrezu has two pincers  each of which can grapple one target. While grappling a target  a pincer can't attack a different target. If the same creature is grappled by both of the glabrezus pincers  it must escape from each of them separately.
- **Wish:** Once per 30 days  the glabrezu can cast wish for a mortal  using no material components. Before doing so  it will demand that the mortal commit a terribly evil act or make a painful sacrifice.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fists:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Rend:** If grappling the same target with both pincers, the glabrezu rips at the target, ending both grapples and dealing 27 (4d10 + 5) slashing damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it dies and is torn in half.
- **Darkness:** Magical darkness spreads from a point within 30 feet, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere and spreading around corners. It remains for 1 minute, until the glabrezu dismisses it, or until the glabrezu uses this ability again. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.
- **Confusion (1/Day):** The glabrezu targets up to three creatures within 90 feet. Each target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, becoming confused for 1 minute on a failure. A target repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
