### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The chuul can breathe air and water.
- **Detect Magic:** The chuul senses a magical aura around any visible creature or object within 120 feet that bears magic.
- **Spell-warped:** The spell-warped Chuul possesses one of the following traits.
- **Absorb Magic:** The chuul has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Whenever the chuul successfully saves against a spell or magical effect, it magically gains 5 (1d10) temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points last, the chuuls pincer attacks deal an additional 3 (1d6) force damage.
- **King-Sized Claw:** One of the chuuls pincers deals 18 (4d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage on a successful hit. A creature grappled by this pincer makes ability checks to escape the grapple with disadvantage.
- **Rune Drinker:** Whenever the chuul takes damage from a magic weapon, until the start of the chuuls next turn attacks made with that weapon have disadvantage, and the chuul gains a +4 bonus to AC.
- **Sparking Wand:** A wand of lightning bolts adorns the chuuls carapace. A creature that starts its turn within 10 feet must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) lightning damage. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the chuul can grab the wand by making a successful DC 14 Athletics or Sleight of Hand check. A creature that fails this check must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isnt knocked prone.
