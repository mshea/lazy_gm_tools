### Actions

- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage  and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). A grappled target takes 3 (1d6) acid damage at the start of each of the jellys turns.

### Reactions

- **Split:** When a Medium or larger jelly with at least 10 hit points is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two jellies that are each one size smaller, freeing any grappled targets. Each new jelly has half the originals hit points (rounded down).
