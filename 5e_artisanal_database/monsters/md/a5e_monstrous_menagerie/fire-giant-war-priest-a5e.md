### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant makes two greatsword attacks.
- **Greatsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (6d6 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure  it is pushed up to 10 feet away from the giant and knocked prone.
- **Rock:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 42 (10d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature  it makes a DC 19 Strength saving throw  falling prone on a failure.
- **Sword Sweep (1/Day, While Bloodied):** The giant makes a greatsword attack against each creature within 10 feet.
- **Ignite Blades (1/Day):** The greatswords of each fire giant of the giants choice within 30 feet magically kindle into flame. For the next minute  each of their greatsword attacks deal an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Pillar of Flame (1/Day):** Each creature within a 10-foot-radius  40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 60 feet that the fire giant can see makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw  taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save or half damage on a success. Unattended flammable objects are ignited.

### Reactions

- **Kick:** When hit by a melee attack by a Medium or smaller creature the giant can see within 10 feet, the giant kicks its attacker. The attacker makes a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 14 (3d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 20 feet from the giant, and falls prone.
