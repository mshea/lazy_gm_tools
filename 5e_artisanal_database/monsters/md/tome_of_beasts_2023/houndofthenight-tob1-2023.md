### Special Abilities

- **Fey Scent:** The hound of the night has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. If it is tracking a Fey, Giant, or Humanoid whose scent it knows, the hound can continue tracking that creature if the creature moves into the Border Ethereal or teleports, provided the creature isn't in the Border Ethereal for more than 1 minute or that the creature doesn't teleport more than 100 feet at a time.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hound of the night makes two Bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Frost Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The hound exhales frost in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Teleport (Recharge 4-6):** The hound magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Before or after teleporting, the hound can make one Bite attack.
