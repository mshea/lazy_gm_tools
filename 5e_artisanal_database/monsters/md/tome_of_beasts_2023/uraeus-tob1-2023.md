### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The uraeus doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Magic Resistance:** The uraeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the target takes 3 (1d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Spit Fire:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (4d6 + 2) fire damage.
- **Searing Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The uraeus exhales a 15-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Ward Bond:** The uraeus forms a magical bond with a willing creature within 5 feet of it. While bonded, the uraeus and its ward know the distance and direction to each other and the general state of each other's health, even if the two are on different planes of existence. The bond lasts until the uraeus or its ward dies, until the uraeus ends it as a bonus action, or until the uraeus uses this bonus action to create a bond with another creature.

### Reactions

- **Bonded Savior:** When the uraeus's bonded ward takes damage, the uraeus prevents the ward from taking the damage and loses hp equal to that amount instead, regardless of the type of damage dealt.
