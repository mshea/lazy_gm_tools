### Special Abilities

- **Counting Compulsion:** If a creature uses an action to point out an ordered group of objects that the rubezahl can see, such as a pile of gravel, the demon is compelled to count the entire group. Until the end of its next turn, the rubezahl has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and it can't take reactions. Once it has counted a given group of objects, it can't be compelled to count those objects again.
- **False Tongue:** The rubezahl has advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks. In addition, magical attempts to discern lies always report that the rubezahl's words are true, and it can't be magically forced to tell the truth.
- **Magic Resistance:** The rubezahl has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The rubezahl makes one Gore attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage, and the target creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Thunderstrike (Recharge 5-6):** The rubezahl calls a sizzling bolt of lightning out of the sky, or from the air if underground or indoors, to strike a point the rubezahl can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 (8d8) lightning damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned.
- **Spellcasting:** The rubezahl casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):<br>At will: disguise self, fog cloud<br>3/day each: gust of wind, sleet storm<br>1/day: control weather (as an action)
