### Special Abilities

- **Divine Animosity:** The wampus cat has advantage on attack rolls against creatures wielding divine or celestial power, such as clerics, paladins, or aasimars.

### Actions

- **Claw (True Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Sweet Song (Recharge 5-6):** The wampus cat sings a sweet melody. Each creature within 60 feet of her that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the wampus cat's Sweet Song for the next 24 hours.
- **Terrifying Yowl (Recharge 5-6):** The wampus cat emits an ear-piercing yowl. Each creature within 15 feet of the wampus cat that can hear the yowl must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The wampus cat magically polymorphs into a Medium female Humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying transforms with her. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
