### Special Abilities

- **Alluring Presence:** When a Humanoid that can see the lorelei starts its turn within 30 feet of the lorelei, the lorelei can force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw if the lorelei isn't incapacitated and can see the Humanoid. On a failed save, the Humanoid is charmed until the start if its next turn. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the lorelei by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the lorelei for a kiss from her. The Humanoid doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage, the Humanoid can repeat the saving throw. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends for it, and it regains its senses for the remainder of its turn.
- **Amphibious:** The lorelei can breathe air and water.
- **Free Water Spirit:** While in contact with water, the lorelei ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce her speed or cause her to be restrained. In addition, she can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lorelei can use her Stunning Glance. She then makes three Psychic Blast attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Corrupted Kiss.
- **Corrupted Kiss:** Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is incapacitated or restrained. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage, and the lorelei regains hp equal to that amount.
- **Psychic Blast:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage.
- **Stunning Glance:** The lorelei sends a seductive glance at a creature she can see within 30 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature is immune to this lorelei's Stunning Glance for the next 24 hours.
