### Special Abilities

- **Blinding Demise:** When the golem reduces a creature to 0 hp, it can blind the creature permanently. If it does so, the creature is reduced to 1 hp instead.
- **Construct Nature:** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Immutable Form:** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Light-Infused Fists:** The golem's Slam attacks are magical. When the golem hits with a Slam attack, the attack deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
- **Magic Resistance:** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The eye golem can use its Primal Voice of Doom. It then makes two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.
- **Gaze of Ancient Light (Recharge 5-6):** The golem opens all of its eyes and emits a burst of blinding light. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Primal Voice of Doom:** The golem intones a disturbing invocation of the sun god at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
