### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The empty cloak doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Diligent Sentinel:** The empty cloak has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
- **Shadow Construction:** Made mostly of shadow, the empty cloak bursts into pieces then dissipates when a creature scores a critical hit against it.
- **Wrapping Embrace:** The empty cloak can occupy a Medium or smaller creature's space and vice versa. It has advantage on attack rolls against any creature in the same space as it.

### Actions

- **Razor Cloak:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Shadow Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Shadow Snare:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained by tendrils of shadow. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. The tendrils of shadow can be attack and destroyed (AC 12; hp 10; vulnerability to radiant damage; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).

### Bonus Actions

- **Protective Embrace:** When a creature the cloak can see attacks a creature in the cloak's space, the cloak can briefly wrap itself around the creature in its space. The creature in its space takes only half the damage from the attack, and the cloak takes the other half.
