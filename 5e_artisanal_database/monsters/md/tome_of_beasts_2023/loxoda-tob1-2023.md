### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The loxoda makes one Slam attack and one Spear attack.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
- **Stomp:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one prone creature. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Tooth-Rattling Pound (Recharge 5-6):** The loxoda rears up and lands heavily, rattling the land and creatures around it. Each creature in contact with the ground within 20 feet of the loxoda must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and takes an extra 10 (3d6) thunder damage at the end of its next turn as the shockwaves from the Tooth-Rattling Pound continue up through its body. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't take extra thunder damage from shockwaves.
