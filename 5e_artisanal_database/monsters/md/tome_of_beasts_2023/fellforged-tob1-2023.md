### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The fellforged doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Inhabiting Spirit:** The fellforged is inhabited and animated by a specter. If the fellforged fails a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, the specter is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the fellforged with the hp total it had before it was expelled. The specter otherwise uses the statistics of a specter.
- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the fellforged has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fellforged makes two Necrotic Slam attacks.
- **Necrotic Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.

### Bonus Actions

- **Burst Gears:** The specter within the fellforged strains the construct's body, sending broken springs and gears flying. Each creature within 5 feet of the fellforged must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each time the fellforged uses this bonus action, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and it can't use this bonus action if its speed is 0. Its speed returns to normal when it finishes a long rest.
