### Special Abilities

- **Eldritch Understanding:** The spider of Leng can read and use any spell scroll or magic item, ignoring all class, race, and level requirements.
- **Poisonous Blood:** A creature that hits the spider of Leng with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) poison damage.
- **Poisonous Death:** When the spider of Leng dies, the poisonous blood in its body vaporizes, forming a cloud in the spider's space until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature within 5 feet of the spider and each creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spider of Leng makes two Claw attacks and one Staff of Leng attack, or it makes three Spit Venom attacks.

- **Staff of Leng:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of is next turn.
- **Spit Venom:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned and blinded until the end of its next turn.
