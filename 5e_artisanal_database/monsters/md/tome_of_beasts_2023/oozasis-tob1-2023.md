### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The oozasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.
- **Oasis Appearance:** While the oozasis remains motionless and partially submerged on the surface of sand or soil, it is indistinguishable from a small oasis or pond. The oozasis's body provides enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the oozasis remains in the area for an extended period of time. A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the oozasis's water is affected by the Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion trait as if it drank the water.
- **Ooze Nature:** The oozasis doesn't require sleep.
- **Waters of Unfathomable Compulsion:** A creature that drinks the water of an oozasis experiences a cryptic dream the next time it sleeps. When it wakes, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the geas spell for 30 days. While under the geas, the affected creature must perform a specific, seemingly minor task that furthers the decades-long goals of the oozasis. Such a task could be planting a white rose in a specific garden, rescuing the next endangered young animal the target encounters, or standing in a specific spot at a certain time each day for three days.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The oozasis makes three Pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The oozasis can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.
- **Compelling Vapors (Recharge 5-6):** The oozasis emits mind-altering vapors. Each creature within 20 feet of the oozasis must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (10d8) psychic damage and suffers either tranquility or turmoil for minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't suffer tranquility or turmoil. A creature suffering tranquility is charmed and can't attack. A creature suffering turmoil is unable to distinguish friend from foe and must move to and attack the nearest creature other than the oozasis on each of its turns, stalking off in a random direction if no creature is in range. A creature suffering tranquility or turmoil can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
