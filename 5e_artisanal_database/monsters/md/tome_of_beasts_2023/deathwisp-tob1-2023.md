- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the deathwisp has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The deathwisp makes two Ghostly Pike attacks, or it can make one Ghostly Pike attack and one Life Drain attack.
- **Ghostly Pike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) force damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Life Drain:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Create Specter:** The deathwisp targets a Humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a specter in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. This specter is under the deathwisp's control. The deathwisp can have no more than twelve specters under its control at one time.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Traveler (3/Day):** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the deathwisp disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
