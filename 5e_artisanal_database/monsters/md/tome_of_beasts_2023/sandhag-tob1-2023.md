### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The sand hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Mimicry:** The sand hag can mimic animal sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Scorpion Walk:** Difficult terrain composed of sand or gravel doesn't cost the hag extra movement. In addition, while in sandy terrain, she doesn't leave tracks and has tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hag makes three Claw attacks. If two Claw attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. A creature can't suffer more than two levels of exhaustion from this effect.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Illusory Appearance:** The sand hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.
- **Scouring Sirocco (Recharge 5-6):** The sand hag generates a blast of hot wind and sand in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) slashing damage and 9 (2d8) fire damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The area is heavily obscured by airborne sand until the start of the sand hag's next turn.
- **Spellcasting:** The sand hag casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):<br>At will: silent image<br>3/day each: hallucinatory terrain (as an action), major image
