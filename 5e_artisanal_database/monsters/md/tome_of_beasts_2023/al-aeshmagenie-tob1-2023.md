### Special Abilities

- **Air Hatred:** The al-aeshma has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are flying.
- **Earth Bound:** The al-aeshma is anchored to the earth and can't fly far from it. The al-aeshma can't willingly fly more than 30 feet above the ground. If it starts its turn more than 30 feet away from the ground, it loses its damage immunities and is vulnerable to lightning and thunder damage until it starts its turn within 30 feet of the ground.
- **Elemental Demise:** When an al-aeshma dies, its body disintegrates into a swirling spray of coarse sand, leaving behind only equipment it was wearing or carrying.
- **Regeneration:** The al-aeshma regains 10 hp at the start of its turn. If it takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the al-Aeshma's next turn. The al-aeshma dies only if it starts its turn at 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.

### Actions

- **Scimitar:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Dust Devil:** The al-aeshma creates a swirling dust devil centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of it. The dust devil appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 5-foot radius. Each creature in the area and each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be restrained. While restrained, a creature takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the al-aeshma's turns. A creature, including a restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check.
- **Spellcasting:** The al-aeshma casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):<br>At will: detect magic<br>3/day each: create or destroy water (destroy only), wind walk (as an action)<br>1/day each: gaseous form, invisibility
