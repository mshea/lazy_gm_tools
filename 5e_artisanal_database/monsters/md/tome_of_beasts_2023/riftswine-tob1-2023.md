### Special Abilities

- **Chaos Mutations:** At the start of each of its turns, the rift swine's body experiences a mutation. Choose an option or roll a d6 to determine the type of mutation. The mutation lasts until the start of the rift swine's next turn.
- **Dozens of Eyes:** The rift swine has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on saving throws against being blinded. In addition, if the rift swine isn't blinded, creatures attacking it can't benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature's allies distracting or surrounding the rift swine, such as the Pack Tactics trait or Sneak Attack class feature.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The rift swine makes one Tusk attack and two Tentacle attacks, or it makes three Warping Bolt attacks.
- **Tusk:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The rift swine has two tentacles, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Warping Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (3d6 + 1) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls as reality-warping energies temporarily distort its body.
