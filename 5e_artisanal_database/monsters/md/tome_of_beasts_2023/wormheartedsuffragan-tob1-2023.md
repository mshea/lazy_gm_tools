### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The wormhearted suffragan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Master of Undeath:** A Humanoid killed by the wormhearted suffragan's disease rises 1d4 hours later as a skeleton or zombie (the suffragan's choice), unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Between its disease and its Animating Worms, the suffragan can have no more than fifteen total skeletons and zombies under its control at one time.
- **Undead Nature:** The wormhearted suffragan doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The wormhearted suffragan makes two Worm-Coated Fist or Paralyzing Bolt attacks.
- **Worm-Coated Fist:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) every 24 hours. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Paralyzing Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **Animating Worms (3/Day):** The wormhearted suffragan touches the body of a dead Humanoid, passing on some of the suffragan's worms. The worms fill the target, animating it as a skeleton or zombie (the suffragan's choice) under the suffragan's control.
