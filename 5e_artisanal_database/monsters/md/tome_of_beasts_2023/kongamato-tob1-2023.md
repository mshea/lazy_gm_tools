- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. The kongamato has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
- **Terrifying Screech (Recharge 5-6):** The kongamato releases a screech in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
