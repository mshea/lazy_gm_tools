### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The garroter crab can breathe air and water.
- **Strangling Divination:** A Humanoid reduced to 0 hp while grappled by the garroter crab experiences a brief vision of the future. This effect works like the divination spell, except the reply is only as a mental vision and it can be about any specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 30 days. Once a creature has received a vision in this way, it can't do so again for 30 days.

### Actions

- **Whip-Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target can't speak or cast spells with verbal components, and the crab can't use its Whip Claw on another target.
