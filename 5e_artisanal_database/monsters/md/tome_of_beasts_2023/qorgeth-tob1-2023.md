If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by Qorgeth. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of Qorgeth's turns.
- **Crush:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is restrained until Qorgeth moves. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 21 Strength check.
- **Stinger:** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 33 (6d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. A creature that fails the saving throw by 10 or more is also paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
