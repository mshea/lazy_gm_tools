### Special Abilities

- **Undead Nature:** The sharkjaw skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). The skeleton can grapple up to two targets at a time.
- **Devouring Embrace:** The sharkjaw skeleton devours a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The grapple ends, the devoured target is restrained in the skeleton's many jaws, and the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the skeleton's turns. If the skeleton moves, the devoured target moves with it. The skeleton can devour only one target at a time. A creature, including the devoured target, can take its action to pry the devoured target out of the skeleton's many jaws by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.
