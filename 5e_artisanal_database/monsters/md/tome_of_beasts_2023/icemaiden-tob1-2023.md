### Special Abilities

- **Chilling Presence:** A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the ice maiden must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) cold damage. Unprotected, nonmagical flames within 15 feet of the maiden are extinguished, and water freezes if it remains within 15 feet of the maiden for at least 1 minute.
- **Ice Walk:** The ice maiden can move across icy and snowy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost her extra movement.
- **Magic Resistance:** The ice maiden has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Snow Sight:** The ice maiden can see through areas obscured by snow or fog without penalty.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ice maiden makes two Ice Blade or Ice Bolt attacks.
- **Ice Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) cold damage.
- **Ice Bolt:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) cold damage.
- **Kiss of the Frozen Heart:** The ice maiden kisses a willing Humanoid, freezing the target's heart. The target has immunity to cold damage, but it is charmed by the ice maiden until the maiden ends the effect (no action required) or until the target is kissed by a creature that loves it. The charmed target obeys the maiden's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm from the maiden or her allies, or if it receives a suicidal command, it can make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The maiden can have no more than three Humanoids charmed at a time.
- **Icy Embrace (Recharge 5-6):** The ice maiden blasts wintry weather on a point she can see within 60 feet of her. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 28 (8d6) cold damage and is restrained by ice until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. The area then becomes icy, difficult terrain for 1 minute.

### Bonus Actions

- **Snow Step:** The ice maiden teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see. The origin and destination spaces must contain snow or ice.
