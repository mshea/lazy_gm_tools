### Special Abilities

- **Red Cap:** The redcap must soak its cap in the blood of a Humanoid that has been dead for no more than 1 hour at least once every 3 days. Every 24 hours past the third day that it goes without soaking its cap in blood in this way, it suffers one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion can be reduced only when the redcap finishes a long rest after soaking its cap in fresh Humanoid blood, which reduces its exhaustion level to 0. If the redcap dies as a result of this exhaustion, it crumbles to dust.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The redcap makes one Bleeding Bite attack and two Pike attacks.
- **Bleeding Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 7 (2d6) hp at the start of each of its turns due to a bleeding wound. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
- **Pike:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Solid Kick:** The redcap kicks a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
