### Special Abilities

- **Sense Magic:** The naina senses magic within 120 feet of her at will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell but isn't itself magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The naina makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or she makes three Slam attacks.
- **Bite (True Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage.

- **Slam (Humanoid Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6, True Form Only):** The naina uses one of the following breath weapons:
- **Poison Breath:** The naina exhales poison breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 40 (9d8) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Paralysis Breath:** The naina exhales paralyzing breath in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Sleep Breath:** The naina exhales sleep gas around it. Each creature within 20 feet of the naina must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it.
- **Spellcasting:** The naina casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):<br>At will: charm person, dancing lights, silent image<br>3/day each: dispel magic, hypnotic pattern, invisibility<br>1/day each: dimension door, dominate person

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The naina transforms into a Medium Humanoid or back into her true form, which is a Dragon. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true from if she dies.
