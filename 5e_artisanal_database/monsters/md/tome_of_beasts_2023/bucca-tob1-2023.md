### Special Abilities

- **Flyby:** The bucca doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity:** The bucca takes 1 radiant damage each minute it is exposed to sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Treasure Sense:** The bucca can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

### Actions

- **Dagger:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Invisibility:** The bucca magically turns invisible until it attacks, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the bucca wears or carries is invisible with it.
