### Special Abilities

- **Huntsman's Weapons:** The Lord of the Hunt's weapon attacks are magical. When he hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 14 (4d6) poison damage (included in the attack).
- **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the Lord of the Hunt fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.
- **Sure Seat:** While mounted and not incapacitated, the Lord of the Hunt can't be knocked prone, dismounted, or moved against his will.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The Lord of the Hunt makes three Spear or Longbow attacks.
- **Spear:** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, or 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage if used in two hands, plus 14 (4d6) poison damage. If the Lord of the Hunt throws the spear, the spear teleports up to 120 feet to the Lord of the Hunt's hand at the start of his next turn. If he has no hand free, the spear teleports to the ground at his feet.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage.
- **Hunter's Quarry:** The Lord of the Hunt magically calls 3d6 elk or boars, 1d4 giant boars or giant elk, or 1 elephant. The called Beasts arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the Lord and obeying its spoken commands. The Beasts remain for 1 hour, until the Lord dies, or until the Lord dismisses them as a bonus action. The Lord can have any number of Beasts under its control at one time provided the combined total CR of the Beasts is no higher than 8.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fey Mount:** The Lord of the Hunt can summon or dismiss a magical Fey mount, mounting or dismounting it as part of this bonus action without spending movement. The mount uses the statistics of a warhorse, except it has 40 hp, is a Fey, has the same damage and condition resistances and immunities as the Lord of the Hunt, and uses the Lord's saving throw bonuses in place of its own. If the mount is slain, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form, and the Lord of the Hunt must wait 1 hour before summoning the mount again.

### Reactions

- **Parry:** The Lord of the Hunt increases his AC by 6 against one attack that would hit him. To do so, he must see the attacker and must be wielding a melee weapon.

The Lord of the Hunt can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The Lord of the Hunt regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

### Legendary Actions

- **Attack:** The Lord of the Hunt makes one Spear or Longbow attack.
- **Tenacious Stride:** The Lord of the Hunt moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If he is mounted, he can force the mount to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks instead.
- **Call to the Hunt (Costs 2 Actions):** The Lord of the Hunt blows his hunting horn and chooses one creature he can see within 60 feet. If the creature can hear the horn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the Lord of the Hunt for 8 hours. The charmed target obeys the Lord's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the Lord's Call to the Hunt for the next 24 hours. The Lord can have only one target charmed at a time. If he charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.
