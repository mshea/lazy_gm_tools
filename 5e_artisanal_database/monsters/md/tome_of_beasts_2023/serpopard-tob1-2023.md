### Special Abilities

- **Coastal Camouflage:** The serpopard has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in sandy, muddy, or swampy terrain.
- **Sinuous Strikeback:** The serpopard gets two extra reactions that can be used only for opportunity attacks.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The serpopard makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Musk (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** The serpopard releases foul-smelling musk in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour or until it spends 10 minutes washing off the musk. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. While a creature is poisoned in this way, any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the poisoned creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn.
