### Special Abilities

- **Firesight:** The ash drake can see through areas obscured by fire, smoke, and fog without penalty.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The drake makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Ash Cloud (Recharge 6):** The ash drake beats its wings, filling the area within 10 feet of it with ash for 1 minute. The ash spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature that isn't an ash drake and that enters the cloud for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of its next turn. The ash moves with the drake, remaining centered on it for the duration.
- **Ash Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The ash drake spews blistering hot, choking ash in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
