- **Woodland Friends (1/Day):** The far darrig magically calls 1d4 elk or giant weasels. The called Beasts arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the far darrig and obeying its spoken commands. The Beasts remain for 1 hour, until the far darrig dies, or until the far darrig dismisses them as a bonus action.

### Bonus Actions

- **Nimble Woodsman:** The far darrig takes the Dash or Disengage action. The far darrig can use this bonus action only if it is in a forest.
