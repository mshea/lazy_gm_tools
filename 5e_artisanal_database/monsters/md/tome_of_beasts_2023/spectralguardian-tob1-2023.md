### Special Abilities

- **Disgrace Bound:** The spectral guardian is bound to a tomb, castle ruins, or other place related to the disgrace in life that caused it to rise as a spectral guardian in death. If the guardian starts its turn more than 1 mile from its bound location, it loses its Spectral Blade action until it returns to the region. If it remains outside the region, it automatically teleports back to its bound location after 24 hours, regardless of distance.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** The spectral guardian can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
- **Undead Nature:** The spectral guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spectral guardian makes two Spectral Blade attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hp maximum reduced by the total necrotic damage dealt by both attacks.
- **Spectral Blade:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
- **Spectral Burst:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) force damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
