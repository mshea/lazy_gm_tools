### Special Abilities

- **Darkness Hypersensitivity:** The liosalfar takes 15 necrotic damage when it starts its turn in magical darkness. While in magical darkness, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Elemental Nature:** The liosalfar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Inscrutable:** The liosalfar is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to ascertain the liosalfar's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.
- **Light Form:** The liosalfar can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. In addition, it sheds bright light in a 10- to 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The liosalfar can alter the radius as a bonus action.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The liosalfar makes two Radiant Touch or Ray of Light attacks. If both Radiant Touch attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
- **Radiant Touch:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (4d10 + 7) radiant damage.
- **Ray of Light:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 31 (6d8 + 4) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
- **Mesmerizing Radiance:** The liosalfar causes the light radiating from its body to shift color and pattern in a spellbinding display. Each creature within 60 feet of the liosalfar and that can see it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the display ends. The liosalfar must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue the display. It can stop the display at any time, and the display ends if the liosalfar is incapacitated. While charmed by the liosalfar's display, a creature is also incapacitated, and its speed is reduced to 0, as it is transfixed by the display. The effect ends for a charmed creature if it takes any damage or if someone uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
