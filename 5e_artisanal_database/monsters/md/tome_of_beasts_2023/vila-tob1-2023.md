### Special Abilities

- **Forest's Defender:** Difficult terrain composed of nonmagical plants doesn't cost the vila extra movement, and it can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, while in forested terrain, the vila has advantage on initiative rolls.
- **Poisoned Weapons:** The vila's weapons are coated with a magical poison harvest from the forest. When the vila hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 2d6 poison damage (included in the attack).
- **Speak with Beasts:** The vila can communicate with Beasts as if they shared a language.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The vila can use its Song of the Forest. It then makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks.
- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Shortbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
- **Song of the Forest:** The vila sings one of the following songs at up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the song's effect.
- **Denizens of the Wilds (1/Day):** The vila magically calls 1d4 wolves or 1 wampus cat. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vila and obeying its spoken commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until the vila dies, or until the vila dismisses them as a bonus action.
