### Special Abilities

- **Beast Hunter:** The elvish veteran archer has advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Beasts and on Intelligence (Nature) checks to recall information about Beasts.
- **Fey Ancestry:** The elvish veteran archer has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the archer to sleep.
- **Keen Hearing and Sight:** The elvish veteran archer has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
- **Point Blank Hunter:** A longbow deals one extra die of its damage when the archer hits with it (included in the attack). In addition, when the archer makes a ranged attack with a longbow, it doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll from being within 5 feet of a hostile creature, though it may still have disadvantage from other sources.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The elvish veteran archer makes three Shortsword attacks or two Longbow attacks.
- **Shortsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Longbow:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the archer can pin part of the target's clothing or body to the ground or to a nearby wall or tree. If it does so, the target is restrained. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the arrow and free the restrained target by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.
- **Arrow Spray (Recharge 5-6):** The elvish veteran archer fires a flurry of arrows in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
