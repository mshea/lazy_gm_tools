### Special Abilities

- **Chilling Acidic Body:** A creature that touches the frostveil or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.
- **Damage Transfer:** While engulfing a creature, the frostveil takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and the engulfed creature takes the other half.
- **False Appearance:** While the frostveil remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a formation of frost and ice.
- **Windborne:** In windy conditions, the frostveil's flying speed increases to 30 feet. In a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour), its flying speed increases to 60 feet.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The frostveil makes two Frozen Tendril attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 15), and the frostveil uses Snowy Engulf on it.
- **Frozen Tendril:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.
- **Snowy Engulf:** The frostveil engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded and restrained, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the frostveil's turns or take 4 (1d8) acid damage and 3 (1d6) cold damage. If the frostveil moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The frostveil can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
- **Spirit Spores (Recharge 6):** The frostveil releases a puff of psychotropic spores around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the frostveil must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) cold damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated. When an incapacitated creature moves, it moves in a random direction. An incapacitated creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
