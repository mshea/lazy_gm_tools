### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The ratatosk has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ratatosk makes two Gore or Annoying Chitter attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Divisive Chatter, if available.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.
- **Annoying Chitter:** Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) psychic damage.
- **Divisive Chatter (Recharge 5-6):** The ratatosk causes division and strife in up to four creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be irritated for 1 minute. While irritated, a creature must spend its action on each of its turns arguing with, complaining about, or otherwise expressing unhappiness toward one of its allies over a trivial matter. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Spellcasting:** The ratatosk casts one of the following spells, requiring no material or somatic components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (save DC 14):<br>At will: animal messenger, message<br>3/day each: sending, suggestion<br>1/day: commune (as an action)

### Bonus Actions

- **Skitter:** The ratatosk takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

### Reactions

- **Desperate Lies:** When a creature the ratatosk can see targets it with an attack, the ratatosk tells a lie while pointing to another creature within 5 feet of it. The attacker must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or believe the lie and attack the other creature instead.
