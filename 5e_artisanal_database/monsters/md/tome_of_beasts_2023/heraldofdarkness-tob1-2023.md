### Special Abilities

- **Made of Shadows (Shadow Form Only):** The herald of darkness has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, it can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Shadow's Sight:** Magical darkness doesn't impede the herald's darkvision.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The herald of darkness makes two Embrace Darkness or Shadow Sword attacks.
- **Embrace Darkness (Shadow Form Only):** Melee Spell Attack: +7 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the herald's space. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **Shadow Sword (Fiend Form Only):** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
- **Majesty of the Abyss (Recharge 5-6):** The herald of darkness emits a sinister burst of infernal power. Each creature within 15 feet of the herald and that can see it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't blinded. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also paralyzed until the end of its next turn. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Bonus Actions

- **Shadow Shape:** The herald magically transforms into a Large shadow or back into its true form, which is a Fiend. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
