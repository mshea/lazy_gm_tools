### Special Abilities

- **Regeneration:** Gains 3 hp at the start of its turn. If the trollkin takes acid or fire this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn. It dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.
- **Thick Skin:** Its skin is thick and tough granting it a +1 bonus to Armor Class (already factored into its AC).

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Uses Mark Foe. Then two Hurl Flame attacks or three Staff attacks.
- **Staff:** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage or 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage if used with 2 hands.
- **Hurl Flame:** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, 120 ft., one target, 8 (2d4+3) fire.
- **Mark Foe:** One creature shaman can see within 60' must make DC 13 Wis save or be wreathed in magical fire for 1 min. While wreathed it can't take the Hide action or become invisible. The next time creature takes damage it takes an extra 7 (2d6) fire and the magical fire ends.

### Reactions

- **Fiery Escape (2/Day):** When shaman takes damage each creature within 5 ft. of it: DC 13 Dex save or take 7 (2d6) fire. Shaman is then wreathed in flames and teleports up to 30' to unoccupied space it can see.
