- **Burrowing Burst:** If it burrows 20'+ as part of its movement it can use this action to emerge in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures and each creature within 10 ft. of the scarab's space takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone (DC 16 Dex half damage and is pushed up to 10 ft. out of the scarab's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice; If no unoccupied space is within range creature instead falls prone in scarab's space). Area within 10 ft. of the scarab's space then becomes difficult terrain.
