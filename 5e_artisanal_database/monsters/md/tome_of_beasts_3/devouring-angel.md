### Special Abilities

- **Assisted Leaping:** Can use its quasi-wings to fly up to 30' on its turn but it must start and end its move on a solid surface such as a roof or the ground. If it is flying at the end of its turn it falls to the ground and takes falling damage.
- **Flexible Form:** Can twist its body into unnatural positions allowing it to easily move through any opening large enough for a Small creature. It can squeeze through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The angel's destination must still have suitable room to accommodate its volume.
- **Keen Smell:** Advantage: smell Wis (Percept) checks.
- **Limited Telepathy:** Can magically communicate simple ideas emotions and images telepathically with any creature within 100' of it that can understand a language.
