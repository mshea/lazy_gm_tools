### Special Abilities

- **Bountiful Death:** When the tripwire patch reduces a creature to 0 hp nearby plants erupt with growth. Plants within 20' of the body become thick overgrown difficult terrain and all plants within a 2-mile radius centered on the point where the creature was killed become enriched for 7 days for each CR of the slain creature (minimum of 7 days) cumulatively increasing in duration each time the patch kills a creature. Enriched plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

### Reactions
