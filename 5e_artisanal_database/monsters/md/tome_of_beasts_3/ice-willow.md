### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While motionless indistinguishable from ice-covered willow tree.
- **Ice Melt:** If it takes fire damage its icicles partially melt. Until the end of the ice willow's next turn creatures have advantage on saves vs. the willow's Icicle Drop and Icicle Spray.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Two Slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 13 (2d8+4) bludgeoning damage + 7 (2d6) cold.
- **Icicle Drop (Recharge 4-6):** Shakes several spear-like icicles loose. Each creature within 10 ft. of the willow must make a DC 15 Dex save taking 9 (2d8) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) cold on a failed save or half damage if made.
- **Icicle Spray (Recharge 6):** Flings icicles in a 30' cone. All in area make a DC 15 Dex save taking 18 (4d8) piercing damage and 14 (4d6) cold on a failed save or half damage if made.

### Reactions

- **Melting Icicles:** When the ice willow takes fire it can immediately use Icicle Drop if available.
