- **Protecting Pounce:** When a rakshasa the servitor can see within 15 ft. of it is the target of an attack the servitor can move up to half its speed toward that rakshasa with o provoking opportunity attacks. If it ends this movement within 5 ft. of the rakshasa the servitor becomes the target of the attack instead.
