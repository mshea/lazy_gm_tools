### Special Abilities

- **Forged Forgery:** Thursir armorers wear armor forged from dwarven armor and shaped to resemble dwarven armor. Skilled blacksmiths can recognize and exploit this design quirk. When a creature proficient with smith's tools scores a critical hit vs. thursir armorer armorer's armor breaks reducing armorer's AC by 5 until armorer repairs armor. If armorer is critically hit by any creature while its armor is broken armor shatters and is destroyed reducing armorer's AC to 12.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Uses Flinging Smash if available. Then two Battleaxe attacks or one Battleaxe and one Shield Bash.
- **Battleaxe:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 14 (2d8+5) slashing damage or 16 (2d10+5) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Shield Bash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft., one target, 10 (2d4+5) bludgeoning damage and the target must make DC 16 Str save or be knocked prone.
- **Flinging Smash (Recharge 5-6):** Makes sweeping strike with shield. Each creature within 10 ft. of armorer: pushed up to 15 ft. away from it and knocked prone (DC 16 Str negates push and prone).
- **Runic Armor (3/Day):** Can inscribe the thurs rune on its armor. When a creature hits armorer with melee weapon attack while rune is active creature takes 4 (1d8) lightning and can't take reactions until start of its next turn. Rune lasts for 1 min.

### Bonus Actions

- **Harness Dwarven Soul:** Draws on the soul fragment trapped in one of the dwarven skulls on its belt. Armorer has advantage on ability checks when using smith's tools and on attack rolls using a battleaxe handaxe light hammer or warhammer until start of its next turn. It carries six skulls on its belt.
