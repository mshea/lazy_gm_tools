### Special Abilities

- **Impenetrable Ego:** While it is conscious and wearing no armor and wielding no shield it adds its Cha modifier to its AC (included above) and saves. Advantage on saves vs. being charmed or frightened.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Psychic Strikes. If it hits one creature with two Psychic Strikes target: DC 16 Int save or stunned until end of its next turn.
- **Psychic Strike:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit 5 ft. or range 60' one target 18 (4d6+4) psychic. 
- **Brain Storm (Recharge 6):** Brutal psychic force wracks foes' psyches. Each creature within 30' of it: 31 (9d6) psychic and poisoned 1 min (DC 16 Int half damage not poisoned). A poisoned creature can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.
- **Spellcasting (Psionics):** Cha (DC 16) no spell components: At will: detect thoughts mage hand (hand invisible) thaumaturgy3/day ea: charm person suggestion1/day ea: levitate telekinesis

### Bonus Actions

- **Bend the Spoon:** Chooses one nonmagical weapon it can see within 30' of it and magically warps it. If weapon is being worn or carried creature doing so can prevent warping via DC 16 Wis save. Warped weapon deals only half its normal damage on a hit and creature wielding warped weapon has disadvantage on attack rolls with it. A creature can repair a warped weapon with mending spell or by spending a short rest repairing it with the appropriate tools.

### Reactions

- **Appeal to the Fervent:** When a creature psychophant can see targets it with attack psychophant calls for aid from its followers switching places with friendly creature within 5 ft. of it. Friendly creature becomes target of the attack instead.
