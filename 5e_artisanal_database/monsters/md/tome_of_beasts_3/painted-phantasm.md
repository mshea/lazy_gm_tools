While an image target appears on surface as a painting drawing or similar and is incapacitated and restrained. Target can see and hear outside surface but can't target those outside surface with spells or cast spells or use features that allow it to leave surface. If surface where target is captured takes damage target takes half. If surface is reduced to 0 hp target freed. Dispel magic (DC 15) cast on surface also frees captured creature. If phantasm takes 20+ damage on a single turn phantasm must make DC 15 Cha save at end of that turn or lose focus releasing all captured creatures.
- **Paint Slash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 7 (1d8+3) slashing damage + 16 (3d10) poison.
