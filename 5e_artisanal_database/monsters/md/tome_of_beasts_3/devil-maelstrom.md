### Special Abilities

- **Devil's Sight:** Magic darkness doesn't impede its darkvision.
- **Influence Weather:** Nearby weather responds to devil's desires. At start of each min devil can choose to change precipitation and wind within 1 mile of it by one stage up or down (no action required). This works like the changing weather conditions aspect of the control weather spell except devil can't change temperature and conditions change immediately.
- **Magic Resistance:** Advantage: spell/magic effect saves.
