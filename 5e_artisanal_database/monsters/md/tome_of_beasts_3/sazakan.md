### Special Abilities

- **Blizzard Heart:** Nearby weather responds to the sazakan's desires. At the start of each hr sazakan can choose to change the precipitation and temperature within 1 mile of it by one stage up or down (no action required). This works like the changing weather conditions aspect of the control weather spell except sazakan can't change wind conditions change immediately and sazakan can never make it warm hot or unbearable heat.
- **Icy Nature:** Infused with elemental power requires only half the amount of air food and drink a Humanoid of its size needs.
- **Wintry Aura:** At the start of each of the sazakan's turns each creature within 5 ft. of it takes 7 (2d6) cold.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** Three Icy Wind Lash attacks.
- **Icy Wind Lash:** Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit 5 ft. or range 60' one target 8 (1d8+4) slashing damage + 7 (2d6) cold. If sazakan scores a critical hit target is restrained by ice until end of its next turn.
- **Ice Whirlwind (Recharge 5-6):** Surrounds itself in icy wind. Each creature within 10 ft. of it:  28 (8d6) cold and pushed up to 15 ft. from sazakan and knocked prone (DC 15 Str half damage and not pushed/knocked prone). If save fails by 5+ creature is also restrained as its limbs become encased in ice. Creature including encased creature can break encased creature free via DC 15 Str check. Encased creature also freed if it takes fire damage.
