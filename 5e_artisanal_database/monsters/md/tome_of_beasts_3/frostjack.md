Any spells of 3rd level or lower that provide resistance to cold and that are within 15 ft. of it immediately end. Water freezes if it remains within 15 ft. of it for at least 1 min.

It must re-save at end of its next turn becoming incapacitated and unable to move or speak as it freezes solid on a failure or ending effect on success. Creature remains frozen until it spends 12+ hrs in a warm area thawing out or until it takes at least 10 fire.
