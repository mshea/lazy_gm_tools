- **Bog Melt:** A creature afflicted with bog melt curse can't regain hp and its hp max is reduced by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hrs that elapse. Also when cursed creature starts its turn within 30' of a creature it can see it has a 50% chance of going into a rage until end of its turn. While raged cursed creature must attack nearest creature. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack cursed creature stalks off in a random direction seeking a target for its rage. Curse lasts until lifted by remove curse spell or similar. If curse reduces creature's hp max to 0 creature dies and body dissolves into viscous puddle of goo. Carnivorous creatures with an Int of 3 or lower that can see or smell the goo must make DC 15 Wis save or drink the goo. After 1 min creature's Bite Claw or Slam attack becomes infused with the curse and any creature hit by that attack: DC 15 Con save or be cursed with bog melt.
