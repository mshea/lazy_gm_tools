### Special Abilities

- **Pack Tactics:** Advantage on attacks vs. creature if 1+ unincapacitated attacker ally is within 5 ft. of target.
- **Snow Stride:** A brumalek can burrow through nonmagical snow and earth. While doing so it doesn't disturb the material it moves through. In addition difficult terrain composed of snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

### Actions

- **Headbutt:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, 5 ft., one target, 6 (1d6+3) bludgeoning damage.
- **Reverberating Howl:** Releases an ear-shattering howl in a 30' cone that is audible 300' away. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 13 Dex save. On a failure a creature takes 5 (2d4) thunder and is deafened for 1 min. On a success the creature takes half the damage and isn't deafened. A deafened creature can re-save at end of each of its turns success ends effect on itself.

### Bonus Actions

- **Skittish:** Can take the Dash or Disengage action.
