### Special Abilities

- **Aura of the Forgotten:** Beasts and Humanoids within 10 ft. of the starving specter have disadvantage on saves.
- **Ethereal Sight:** Can see 60' into the Ethereal Plane.
- **Life Hunger:** When a creature specter can see regains hp specter's next Bite deals extra 7 (2d6) necrotic on a hit.
- **Incorporeal Movement:** Move through others/objects as difficult terrain. Takes 5 (1d10) force if it ends turn in object.
- **Undead Nature:** Doesn't require air food drink or sleep.
- **Unnerving Visage:** When a creature that can see specter's faces starts its turn within 30' of it at least one of specter's faces shifts to look like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies if specter isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. Creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic and is frightened of specter until start of its next turn (DC 14 Wis negates both). Unless surprised a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the save at start of its turn. If creature does so it can't see the specter until the start of its next turn when it can avert again. If creature looks at specter in the meantime it must immediately save.
