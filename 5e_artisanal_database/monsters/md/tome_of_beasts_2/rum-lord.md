### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Drunkenness:** The rum lord radiates an aura of drunkenness to a radius of 20 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has consumed alcohol within the past hour has disadvantage on the saving throw. While poisoned, a creature falls prone if it tries to move more than half its speed during a turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the rum gremlin lord's Aura of Drunkenness for 24 hours.
- **Hearty:** The rum lord adds its Constitution modifier to its AC (included in the Armor Class).
- **Magic Resistance:** The rum lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **One for the Road:** When the rum lord hits a poisoned enemy with any weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage.
- **Innate Spellcasting:** The rum lord's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
At will: prestidigitation
3/day: command

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The rum lord makes two attacks: one with its ale tap scepter and one with its broken bottle shiv.
- **Ale Tap Scepter:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Broken Bottle Shiv:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.
- **Rotgut Belch (Recharge 6):** The rum lord vomits green bile in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 18 (4d8) poison damage and is covered in green bile for 1 minute. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't covered in bile. A creature, including the target, can take an action to wipe off the bile. Rum gremlins have advantage on attack rolls against creatures covered in a rum lord's green bile.
- **Bring Me Another Round! (1/Day):** The rum lord lets out a thunderous belch, calling 1d4 rum gremlins. The called rum gremlins arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the lord and obeying its spoken commands. The rum gremlins remain for 1 hour, until the lord dies, or until the lord dismisses them as a bonus action.
