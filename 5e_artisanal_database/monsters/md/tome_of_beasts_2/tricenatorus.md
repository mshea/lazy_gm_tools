### Special Abilities

- **Blood Frenzy:** The tricenatorus has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hp.
- **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):** If the tricenatorus takes 40 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hp, it is reduced to 1 hp instead.
- **Siege Monster:** The tricenatorus deals double damage to objects and structures.
- **Tail Spike Regrowth:** The tricenatorus has twenty-four tail spikes. Used spikes regrow when the tricenatorus finishes a long rest.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tricenatorus makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its gore, or two with its tail spikes. It can't use its gore against a creature restrained by its bite.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tricenatorus can't bite another target.
- **Gore:** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Tail Spike:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, range 150/300 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage.
