- **Magic Resistance:** The repository has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The repository's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Self-Destruct:** If a repository is reduced to 0 hp, it explodes, leaving behind its small, pyramidal chest cavity. Each creature within 20 feet of the repository when it explodes must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The repository makes two slash attacks.
- **Slash:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Language Lash (Recharge 5-6):** The repository utters words of power, unleashing psychic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't stunned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
