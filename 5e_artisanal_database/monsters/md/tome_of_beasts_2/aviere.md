### Special Abilities

- **Divine Rejuvenation:** An aviere that dies collapses into a pile of ash. Each day the pile of ash is within 1 mile of a holy site of its deity or a worshiper of its deity, it has a 75 percent chance of returning to life, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. This chance increases to 100 percent if a worshiper of the aviere's deity prays over the aviere's ashes at dawn. If unholy water is sprinkled on the aviere's ashes, the aviere can't return to life, except through a wish spell or divine will.
