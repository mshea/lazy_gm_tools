### Special Abilities

- **Antimagic Susceptibility:** The swarm is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the swarm must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
- **Deafening Clatter:** A creature in the swarm's space is deafened.
- **False Appearance:** While the greed swarm remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal pile of coins and valuables.
- **Swarm:** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny object. Except for Gather, the swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

### Actions

- **Coin Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the greed swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
- **Coin Barrage:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
- **Gather (1/Day):** The swarm magically gathers up to 100 gp worth of coins, gems, and other small, valuable objects within 60 feet of it, adding them to its mass. It regains 7 (2d6) hit points and has advantage on its next attack roll. A creature wearing or carrying such valuables must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or its valuables fly toward the swarm, joining the mass.
