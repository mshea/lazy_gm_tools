### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The spawn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Tunneler:** The spawn can move through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The spawn of Hriggala makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tendrils.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the spawn can't bite another target.
- **Tendrils:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. No physical trace of the creature remains when killed in this way.
- **Escape the Material:** The spawn burrows at least 20 feet through natural rock and opens a portal to the plane of the undead at the end of this movement. The portal remains for 2d4 rounds. The spawn can't have more than one portal open at a time.
