### Special Abilities

- **Aura of Pain:** At the start of each of the qiqirn's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on its next melee attack roll.
- **Keen Smell:** The qiqirn has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell. Self-loathing. A creature the qiqirn can hear can use its action to say “qiqirn” and make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. If it does so, the qiqirn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to the creature's Charisma (Intimidation) check or be frightened of that creature until the end of its next turn. If the qiqirn succeeds on the saving throw, it can't be frightened by that creature for the next 24 hours.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tormented qiqirn makes two bite attacks. Alternatively, it can use Spiteful Howl twice.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Spiteful Howl:** The qiqirn releases a spiteful howl at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the qiqirn, it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Unnerving Whispers (Recharge 5-6):** The qiqirn whispers the last words of the spirits infusing it into the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 21 (6d6) psychic damage and suffer a random effect for 1 minute. Roll a d6 to determine the effect: unconscious (1), deafened (2), incapacitated (3), stunned (4), frightened (5), paralyzed (6). A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

- **Protective Spirits:** When the qiqirn takes damage, the spirits infusing it rise up to protect it. Roll 2d8 and reduce the damage by the result.
