### Special Abilities

- **Evasion:** If the dancing foliage is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the dancing foliage instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
- **False Appearance:** While the dancing foliage remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a flowering shrub or small tree.
- **Nimble Dance:** The dancing foliage can take the Dash or Disengage action as a bonus action on each of its turns.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dancing foliage makes four attacks with its serrated leaves.
- **Serrated Leaves:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Flower Dance (Recharge 4-6):** The dancing foliage uses one of the following flower dances: <br>* Alluring Dance. The dancing foliage sways, releasing scintillating petals. Up to three creatures of the foliage's choice that can see the petals and that are within 20 feet of the foliage must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0 as it watches the swirling and falling petals. The effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it out of its stupor. <br>* Serrated Dance. The dancing foliage whirls a flurry of serrated leaves around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the dancing foliage must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

- **Shower of Petals:** When a creature the dancing foliage can see targets it with an attack, it releases a shower of flower petals, giving the attacker disadvantage on that attack roll.
