### Special Abilities

- **Diving Head Slam:** If the tetomatli is flying and moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a head slam attack on the same turn, the tetomatli can use Tremor as a bonus action, if it is available.
- **Heavy Flier:** The tetomatli can fly up to 30 feet each round, but it must start and end its movement on a solid surface such as a roof or the ground. If it is flying at the end of its turn, it falls to the ground and takes falling damage.
- **Magic Resistance:** The tetomatli has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The tetomatli's weapon attacks are magical.
- **Siege Monster:** The tetomatli deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The tetomatli makes one head slam attack and one wing buffet attack.
- **Head Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the tetomatli scores a critical hit against a target wearing metal armor, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or its armor is destroyed. A creature wearing magical armor has advantage on this saving throw. A creature wearing adamantine armor is unaffected.
- **Wing Buffet:** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
- **Tremor (Recharge 6):** The tetomatli slams its head repeatedly into the ground, creating a magical shockwave. Each creature within 20 feet of the tetomatli must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and have disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity checks until the end of its next turn.
