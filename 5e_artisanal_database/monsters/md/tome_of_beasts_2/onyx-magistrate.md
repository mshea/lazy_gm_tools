### Special Abilities

- **Immutable Form:** The onyx magistrate is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance:** The onyx magistrate has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Magic Weapons:** The onyx magistrate's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The onyx magistrate makes three scepter attacks. Alternatively, it can use Necrotic Ray twice.
- **Scepter:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Necrotic Ray:** Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage.
- **Dire Judgement (1/Day):** Each creature of the onyx magistrate's choice that is within 30 feet of the magistrate and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed with dire judgment. While cursed in this way, the creature can't regain hp by magical means, though it can still regain hp from resting and other nonmagical means. In addition, when a cursed creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number from the attack roll or saving throw. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.

### Reactions

- **Tip the Scales (Recharge 5-6):** The onyx magistrate adds 3 to its AC against one attack that would hit it. Alternatively, the onyx magistrate succeeds on a saving throw it failed.
