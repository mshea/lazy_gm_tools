### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The carnivorous ship can breathe air and water.
- **Drones:** Each day at dawn, the carnivorous ship produces up to 12 vaguely humanoid drones. Drones share a telepathic link with the carnivorous ship and are under its control. A drone uses the statistics of a zombie, except it can't be knocked prone while on the carnivorous ship and can attach itself to the ship as a reaction when the ship moves. The carnivorous ship can have no more than 12 drones under its control at one time.
- **Shapechanger:** The carnivorous ship can use its action to polymorph into a Gargantuan ship (such as a galleon) or back into its true, amorphous form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The carnivorous ship makes two bite attacks.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage.
- **Spit Cannonballs:** The carnivorous ship spits cannonball-like lumps of indigestible metal at up to three points it can see within 100 feet of it. Each creature within 5 feet of a point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Surge:** The carnivorous ship moves up to 400 feet in a straight line and can move through Huge and smaller objects as if they were difficult terrain. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If it moves through a Huge or smaller object, the object takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage. If it moves through a ship, the ship's pilot can make a DC 15 Wisdom check using navigator's tools, halving the damage on a success.
