### Special Abilities

- **Amorphous:** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
- **Arboreal Movement:** The ooze can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. Creatures preserved inside of it are expelled into unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the tree when the amber ooze moves in this way. The amber ooze can end its turn inside a tree, but it is expelled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the tree if the tree is destroyed.
- **Spider Climb:** The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The amber ooze uses its Engulf. It then makes two pseudopod attacks.
- **Pseudopod:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a plant or plant creature, it also takes 3 (1d6) acid damage.
- **Engulf:** The ooze moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the ooze enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.<br><br>On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the ooze. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.<br><br>On a failed save, the ooze enters the creature's space and the creature is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and, after 1d4 rounds, the creature is petrified. A creature petrified by the ooze remains petrified until 24 hours after it exits the ooze. When the ooze moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.<br><br>An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze.
