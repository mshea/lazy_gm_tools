### Special Abilities

- **Undead Fortitude:** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hp instead.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon zombie makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) necrotic damage.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.
- **Rotting Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon zombie exhales rotting breath in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hp by this damage dies, and it rises as a zombie and acts immediately after the dragon zombie in the initiative count. The new zombie is under the control of the creature controlling the dragon zombie.
