Instead, at the start of each of the leech's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hp due to blood loss.<br><br>The leech can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 15 hp of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the leech.
