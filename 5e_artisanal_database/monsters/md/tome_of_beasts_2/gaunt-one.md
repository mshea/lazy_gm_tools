- **Extract Heart:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one humanoid grappled by the gaunt one. Hit: The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the gaunt one kills the target by extracting and devouring its heart.
