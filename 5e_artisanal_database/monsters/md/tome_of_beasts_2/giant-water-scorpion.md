### Special Abilities

- **Hold Breath:** The scorpion can hold its breath for 1 hour. If it is within 15 feet of the water's surface, it can use its tail as a breathing tube and doesn't need to hold its breath.
- **Poison Injection:** When the scorpion hits with a proboscis attack against a grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned creature, it deals an extra 10 (3d6) poison damage.
- **Underwater Camouflage:** The scorpion has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while underwater.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant water scorpion makes two claw attacks. If it is grappling a creature, it can use its proboscis once.
- **Proboscis:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Medium or smaller creature and the scorpion doesn't have another creature grappled.
