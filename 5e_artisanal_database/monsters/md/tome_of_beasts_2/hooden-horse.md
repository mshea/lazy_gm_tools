### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The hooden horse makes two blade of retribution attacks.
- **Blade of Retribution:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) necrotic damage. The target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is a perpetrator of the crime that provoked the hooden horse's creation, it has disadvantage on this saving throw.
- **Call to Judgment:** The hooden horse points at a being it can see and demands that the creature submit to justice. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the hooden horse, the target must take the Dash action on its turn to move toward the hooden horse by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but, before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can repeat the saving throw. The creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns or whenever it takes damage from the hooden horse. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.<br><br>The hooden horse can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.
