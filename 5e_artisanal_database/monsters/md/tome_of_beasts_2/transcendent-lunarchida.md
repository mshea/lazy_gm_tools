- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the lunarchidna has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Web Walker:** The lunarchidna ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.
- **Spellcasting:** The lunarchidna is a 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The lunarchidna has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): minor illusion, mage hand, poison spray, ray of frost
1st level (4 slots): color spray, detect magic, magic missile, shield
2nd level (3 slots): alter self, suggestion, web
3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, fireball, major image

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The lunarchidna makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
- **Web (Recharge 5-6):** Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action the restrained target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Lunar Beam (Recharge 5-6):** The lunarchidna flashes a beam of moonlight in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
