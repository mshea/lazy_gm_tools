### Special Abilities

- **Memory Loss:** A creature that sees or interacts with a faceless wanderer must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw 1 minute after the faceless wanderer leaves. On a failure, the details of the faceless wanderer and the events surrounding its appearance rapidly fade away from the creature's mind, including the presence of the faceless wanderer.
- **Regeneration:** The faceless wanderer regains 5 hp at the start of its turn. If a creature hasn't failed the saving throw of the faceless wanderer's Memory Drain within the last 1 minute, this trait doesn't function until a creature fails it. If a faceless wanderer is reduced to 0 hp while it is still capable of regenerating, its body dissipates into vapor and reforms 1d10 days later somewhere in the Void. Otherwise, it is permanently destroyed.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The faceless wanderer makes two attacks, but it can use its Memory Drain only once.
- **Claws:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic damage.
- **Memory Drain:** The faceless wanderer drains memories from an adult creature within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage and its Intelligence score is reduced by 1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Intelligence to 0. A humanoid slain in this way rises 1d4 hours later as a new faceless wanderer. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. On a success, the target takes half the damage and its Intelligence score isn't reduced.
