### Special Abilities

- **Sunlight Sensitivity:** While in sunlight, the flayed wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
- **Torturer:** When the flayed wraith reduces a creature to 0 hp, it knocks out the creature, which falls unconscious and is stable.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The flayed wraith uses its Howl of Agony. It then makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage plus 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.
- **Howl of Agony:** The wraith screams its pain into the mind of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and is incapacitated as it doubles over in pain. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated.
