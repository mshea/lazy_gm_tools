### Special Abilities

- **Regeneration:** The fleshdreg regains 5 hp at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hp. If the fleshdreg uses its Disgorge Innards action, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The fleshdreg makes two slam attacks.
- **Slam:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Rock:** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
- **Disgorge Innards (Recharge 6):** The fleshdreg expels acidic sludge in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw takes 9 (2d8) acid damage the end of its next turn, unless it or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to remove the sludge.
