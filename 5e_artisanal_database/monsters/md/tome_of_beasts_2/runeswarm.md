### Special Abilities

- **Magic Resistance:** The runeswarm has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **Swarm:** The runeswarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hp or gain temporary hp.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The runeswarm can use Runecast. It then makes two cutting runes attacks.
- **Cutting Runes:** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 15 (6d4) slashing damage, or 7 (3d4) slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hp or fewer.
- **Runecast:** The runes swirling within the swarm form into the shape of a random rune, causing one of the following magical effects. Roll a d6 to determine the effect.<br>1. Algiz. The runeswarm magically calls 2d4 elk or 1 megaloceros. The called creatures arrive on initiative count 20 of the next round and defend the runeswarm. The beasts remain for 1 minute or until the runeswarm dies.<br>2. Dagaz. The runeswarm emits a burst of blinding light. Each creature within 20-feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.<br>3. Ehwaz, Raido. A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm gains the benefits of the expeditious retreat and freedom of movement spells for 1 minute.<br>4. Ingwaz. A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm receives a brief glimpse of the immediate future and has advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.<br>5. Isaz, Kaunen, Sowilo, Turisaz. Fire, lightning, radiance, or cold winds swirl around the runeswarm. Each creature within 20 feet of the swarm must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold (isaz), fire (kaunen), radiant (sowilo) or lightning (turisaz) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll a d4 to determine the rune: isaz (1), kaunen (2), sowilo (3), turisaz (4).<br>6. Tewaz. The runeswarm glows with a baleful light. Each creature within 20 feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.
