### Special Abilities

- **Mimicry:** The crocotta can mimic animal sounds, humanoid voices, and even environmental sounds. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check.
- **Paralyzing Gaze:** When a creature that can see the crocotta's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the crocotta, the crocotta can force it to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if the crocotta isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed until the start of its next turn.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the crocotta until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the crocotta in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

Canines are immune to the crocotta's Paralyzing Gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have advantage on the saving throw.
- **Pounce:** If the crocotta moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the crocotta can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
