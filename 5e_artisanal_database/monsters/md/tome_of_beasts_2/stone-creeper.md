### Special Abilities

- **False Appearance:** While the stone creeper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary vine.
- **Mass of Vines:** The stone creeper can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.
- **Spider Climb:** The stone creeper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

- **Thorned Vine:** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (2d4) acid damage.
- **Acid-coated Thorn:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) acid damage.
- **Weaken Stone:** While climbing on a wall or ceiling made of worked stone, the stone creeper injects its acid into the mortar, weakening the structure. Each creature within 10 feet of the wall or in a 10-foot cube beneath the ceiling must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its saving throw when beneath a ceiling is also knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the rubble and free the buried target by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check.
