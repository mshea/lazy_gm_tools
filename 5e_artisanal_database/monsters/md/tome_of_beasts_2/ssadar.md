### Special Abilities

- **One with Fire:** Ssadars have an affinity for fire and hold beings of fire in high esteem. Ssadar priests bless ssadar warriors by imbuing them with fire before sending them into battle. A non-ssadar fire-wielder who enters a ssadar city might earn enough respect from the ssadar to be sacrificed last or in a grander ritual to the greatest of their gods.
- **Kinship with Fire:** When the ssadar is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead has advantage on melee attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The ssadar makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its longsword. Alternatively, it can use Spit Fire twice.
- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
- **Longsword:** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
- **Spit Fire:** Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
