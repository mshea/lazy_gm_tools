### Special Abilities

- **Construct Nature:** The living colossus doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Construct Resilience:** The living colossus is immune to poison and psychic damage, and it is immune to exhaustion and the charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions.
- **False Appearance:** While the living colossus remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue or monument of the individual it represents.
- **Immutable Form:** The living colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Siege Monster:** The living colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The living colossus makes three Slam attacks, or it makes four Spirit Blast attacks.
- **Slam:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 32 (4d10+10) bludgeoning damage.
- **Spirit Blast:** _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 24 (4d8+6) psychic damage.
- **Thunderous Clap (Recharge 5-6):** The living colossus slams its hands together, creating a thunderous wave in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 CON save, taking 59 (17d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

- **Quake:** The living colossus strikes the ground with its foot. Each creature within 30 feet of the living colossus must succeed on a DC 18 STR save or be knocked prone and have the air knocked from its lungs, if it is a breathing creature, until the start of the living colossus's next turn. A creature with the air knocked from its lungs can't speak or cast spells with verbal components. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the start of the living colossus's next turn.

### Reactions

- **Bolstering Spirit:** When a friendly creature the living colossus can see within 60 feet of it, other than itself, takes damage, the living colossus can share some of the life force of the spirit animating it with that friendly creature. The target gains 14 (4d6) temporary HP for 1 minute. If the target would take enough damage to reduce it to 0 HP, it instead regains 14 (4d8) HP.
