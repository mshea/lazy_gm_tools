### Special Abilities

- **Giant Attributes:** The frost giant is resistant to the stunned condition, and it is vulnerable to the prone condition.
- **Ice Walk:** The frost giant can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. In addition, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
- **Snowsight:** The frost giant can see through areas obscured by snowfall, sleet, and other wintry precipitation without penalty.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The giant makes two Icy Greataxe or Ice Boulder attacks.
- **Icy Greataxe:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 25 (3d12+6) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.
- **Ice Boulder:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 18 (3d10+2) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.
- **Avalanche (Recharge 5-6):** The frost giant sends out a wave of snow in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 DEX save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 18 (4d8) cold damage and is buried. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't buried. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 16 STR check.

### Bonus Actions

- **Wintry Blast:** A blast of wintry air extends in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide from the frost giant's outstretched hand. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 16 CON save or its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is petrified in ice for 1 hour or until a creature spends 1 minute warming the petrified creature.
