### Special Abilities

- **Elemental Nature:** The fire elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
- **Elemental Resilience:** The fire elemental is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, it is immune to poison damage, to exhaustion, and to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, and unconscious conditions.
- **Fire Camouflage:** The fire elemental's Stealth is 18 while in a Medium or larger fire.
- **Fire Form:** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or take 5 (1d10) fire damage and catch fire; until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Illumination:** The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
- **Water Susceptibility:** For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The elemental makes two Fiery Touch or Spit Fire attacks.
- **Fiery Touch:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 12 (2d8+3) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
- **Spit Fire:** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (3d8+3) fire damage.

### Bonus Actions

- **Fiery Dash (Recharge 4-6):** The elemental moves up to 20 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature without provoking opportunity attacks. Each space along that line catches fire until the start of the elemental's next turn. A creature that enters a burning space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 DEX save or take 5 (1d10) fire damage.
