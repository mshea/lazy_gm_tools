### Special Abilities

- **Amphibious:** The dragon can breathe air and water.
- **Golden Splendor:** When the gold dragon hasn't unleashed its Fire Breath, its scales gleam and sparkle like molten gold or a pile of gold coins. While the dragon's Fire Breath is available, each creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 17 CHA save or be charmed until the start of its next turn.

### Actions

- **Multiattack:** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Weakening Breath, if available.
- **Bite:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10+6) piercing damage.
- **Claw:** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6+6) slashing damage.
- **Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 DEX save, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Weakening Breath (Recharge 6):** As the **gold dragon wyrmling**, except it is a 30-foot cone, and the save DC is 17.

### Bonus Actions

- **Change Shape:** The dragon magically transforms into a Beast or Humanoid that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form, which is Dragon. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it or is borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). It reverts to its true form if it dies. In a new form, the dragon retains its HP, ability to speak, proficiencies, and INT, WIS, and CHA scores, as well as this bonus action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
