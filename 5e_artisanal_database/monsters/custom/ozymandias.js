***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If Ozymandias fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Arcane Weaver.*** Ozymandias can change the damage type of any of his spells or attacks to acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant damage at will.

***Aura of Death.*** The first time a creature moves within 30 feet of Ozymandias or starts their turn there, they take 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. Any creature who restores hit points while within 30 feet of Ozymandias restores only half the expected number of hit points.

***Spellcasting.*** Ozymandias is a master of magic. He knows and can cast any spell in existence, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The following are some of Ozymandias's commonly used spells, any of which he can replace with any known spell of the same level:

At will: *alter self*, *counterspell*, *detect magic*, *dispel magic*, *gaseous form*, *invisibility*, *light*, *mage hand*, *magic circle*, *major image*, *message*, *prestidigitation*, *shield*

3/day each: *disintegrate*, *mind blank*, *plane shift*, *polymorph*, *telekinesis*, *wish*

***Robes of the Archmagi.*** The Ozymandias has resistance to all magical spells and effects.

#### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Ozymandias makes two Claw of Ibraxus attacks and uses Hurl Through the Arches. He can replace any of these actions with a use of his Staff of the Magi or a use of his Ring of Three Wishes.

***Claw of Ibraxus.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 36 (8d8) force damage.

***Hurl Through the Arches.*** One creature within 120 feet of Ozymandias who Ozymandias can see must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is hurled through a temporary archway created by Ozymandias, takes 44 (8d10) force damage, and disappears until the start of their next turn. The creature reappears in an unoccupied space of Ozymandias's choosing within 60 feet of Ozymandias. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not disappear.

***Twin Eyes of Death (1/Day).*** Two creatures within 120 feet of Ozymandias who Ozymandias can see must each make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies.

***Staff of the Magi***. Ozymandias can cast lightning bolt, fireball, or dispel magic. DC 23 Dexterity, 42 damage.

***Ring of Three Wishes**. Ozymandias does one of the following one time:

- Cast True Resurrection on Xereth, his dragon mount.
- Cast Meteor Swarm (DC 23).
- Summon a tarrasque from the world of Falx.
- Remove all resistances and immunities to spells.

#### Bonus Actions

***Curse of Arkus.*** One creature within 120 feet of Ozymandias has disadvantage on saving throws until the start of Ozymandias's next turn.

***Step Through the Arch.*** Ozymandias teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 90 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

#### Legendary Actions

**Claw of Ibraxus.** Ozymandias makes a Claw of Ibraxus attack.

**Elemental Apocalypse (Once per Round).** If Ozymandias is at half his hit points or fewer, he creates a burst of energy in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on his position. Each creature of Ozymandias's choice within that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 42 (12d6) damage of a type chosen by Ozymandias and 42 (12d6) damage of a second chosen type, including acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant damage. A creature takes half as much damage on a successful save.
