## Gaining Spells

Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a *Spell Scroll*. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.

### Preparing Spells

If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.

Table: Spell Preparation by Class

| Class    | Change When You …    | Number of Spells |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Bard     | Gain a level         | One              |
| Cleric   | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Druid    | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |
| Paladin  | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Ranger   | Finish a Long Rest   | One              |
| Sorcerer | Gain a level         | One              |
| Warlock  | Gain a level         | One              |
| Wizard   | Finish a Long Rest   | Any              |

Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.

### Always-Prepared Spells

Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn't count against the number of spells on that list.
