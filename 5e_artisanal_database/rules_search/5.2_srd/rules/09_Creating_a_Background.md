## Creating a Background

A character's background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating a unique background or customizing an existing one can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create a background to help a player craft the story they have in mind for their character.

This section describes, step by step, how you can create backgrounds tailored for your world and the heroes in it.

### 1: Choose Abilities

Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the background:

**Strength or Dexterity.** These abilities are ideal for a background involving physical exertion.

**Constitution.** This ability is ideal for a background that involves endurance or long hours of activity.

**Intelligence or Wisdom.** One or both abilities are ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or spiritual matters.

**Charisma.** This ability is ideal for a background that involves performance or social interaction.
