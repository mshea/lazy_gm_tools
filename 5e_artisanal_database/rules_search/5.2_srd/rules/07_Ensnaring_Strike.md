#### Ensnaring Strike

*Level 1 Conjuration (Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Bonus Action, which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a weapon 

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has Advantage on this save. On a failed save, the target has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While Restrained, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.
