## Stat Block Overview

A monster has a stat block that contains the rules necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts:

- **Name and General Details.** The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along with any descriptive tags), and alignment.
- **Combat Highlights.** Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, and Initiative are provided here.
- **Ability Scores.** A monster's ability scores, ability modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.
- **Other Details.** The monster's Senses, Languages, and CR entries appear here. Additional details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies, Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster lacks those details, entries for them don't appear.
- **Traits.** Monster characteristics that are active at all times or during certain situations appear here.
- **Actions.** The monster can take the actions here in addition to those in "Playing the Game."
- **Bonus Actions.** This section provides a monster's Bonus Actions, if any.
- **Reactions and Legendary Actions.** These sections provide Reactions and Legendary Actions, if any.
