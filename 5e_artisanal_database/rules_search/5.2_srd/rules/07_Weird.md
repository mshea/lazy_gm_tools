#### Weird

*Level 9 Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 10d10 Psychic damage and has the Frightened condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A Frightened target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
