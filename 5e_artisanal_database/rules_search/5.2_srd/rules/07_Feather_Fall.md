#### Feather Fall

*Level 1 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you falls

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down) 

**Duration:** 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, the creature takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.
