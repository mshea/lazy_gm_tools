#### Helm of Telepathy

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast *Detect Thoughts* or *Suggestion* (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
