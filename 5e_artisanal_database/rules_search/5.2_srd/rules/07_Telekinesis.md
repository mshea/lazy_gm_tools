**_Creature._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the Restrained condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there.

**_Object._** You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range.
