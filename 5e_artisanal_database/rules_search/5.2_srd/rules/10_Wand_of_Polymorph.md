#### Wand of Polymorph

*Wand, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast *Polymorph* (save DC 15) from it.

**_Regaining Charges._** The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
