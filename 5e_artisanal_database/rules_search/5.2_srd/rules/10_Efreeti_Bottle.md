#### Efreeti Bottle

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an **Efreeti** appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.

| 1d10 | Effect                       |
|------|------------------------------|
| 1    | The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 2–9  | The efreeti understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 10   | The efreeti understands your languages and can cast *Wish* once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |
