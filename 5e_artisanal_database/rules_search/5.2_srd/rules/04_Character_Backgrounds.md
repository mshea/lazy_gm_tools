## Character Backgrounds

Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure.

### Parts of a Background

A background includes the following parts.

#### Ability Scores

A background lists three of your character's ability scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20.

#### Feat

A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in "Feats").

#### Skill Proficiencies

A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills.

#### Tool Proficiency

Each background gives a character proficiency with one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan's Tools category. Tools are detailed in "Equipment."
