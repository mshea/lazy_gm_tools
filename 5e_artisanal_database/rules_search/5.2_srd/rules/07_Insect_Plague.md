#### Insect Plague

*Level 5 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 300 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a locust) 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.
