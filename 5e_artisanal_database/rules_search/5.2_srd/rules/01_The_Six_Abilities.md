## The Six Abilities

All creatures — characters and monsters—have six abilities that measure physical and mental characteristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.

Table: Ability Descriptions

| Ability      | Score Measures …                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Physical might                      |
| Dexterity    | Agility, reflexes, and balance      |
| Constitution | Health and stamina                  |
| Intelligence | Reasoning and memory                |
| Wisdom       | Perceptiveness and mental fortitude |
| Charisma     | Confidence, poise, and charm        |

### Ability Scores

Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

Table: Ability Scores

| Score | Meaning                                      | 
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens. |
| 2–9   | This represents a weak capability.           |
| 10–11 | This represents the human average.           |
| 12–19 | This represents a strong capability.         |
| 20    | This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise. |
| 21–29 | This represents an extraordinary capability. |
| 30    | This is the highest a score can go.          |

### Ability Modifiers

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in “D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

> **Round Down**
> Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.
