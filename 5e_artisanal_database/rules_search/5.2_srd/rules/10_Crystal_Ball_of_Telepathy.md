#### **Crystal Ball of Telepathy**

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast *Scrying* (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast *Suggestion* (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this *Suggestion* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *Scrying* ends. You can't cast *Suggestion* in this way again until the next dawn.
