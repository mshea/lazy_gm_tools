## Weapons

The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the "Properties" section.
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the "Mastery Properties" section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

> ### Selling Equipment
> 
> Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art objects—retain their full value in the marketplace. "Magic Items" has prices for magic items.

### Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

### Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

#### Finesse

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy

You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

#### Light

When you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Loading

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Range

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Reach

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.

#### Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

#### Two-Handed

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### Versatile

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

> ### Improvised Weapons
>
> If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "Improvised Weapons" in "Rules Glossary." Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.

#### Cleave

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Nick

When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

#### Topple

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

#### Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.
