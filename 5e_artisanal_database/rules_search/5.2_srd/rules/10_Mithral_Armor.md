#### Mithral Armor

*Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor), Uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
