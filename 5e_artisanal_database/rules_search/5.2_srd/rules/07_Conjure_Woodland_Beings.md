#### Conjure Woodland Beings

*Level 4 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action

You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot Emanation for the duration. Whenever the Emanation enters the space of a creature you can

see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the Disengage action as a Bonus Action for the spell's duration.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4.
