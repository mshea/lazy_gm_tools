#### Shield of Missile Attraction

*Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)*

While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

**_Curse._** This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
