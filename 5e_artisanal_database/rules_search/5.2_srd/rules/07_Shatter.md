#### Shatter

*Level 2 Evocation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica) 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has Disadvantage on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.
