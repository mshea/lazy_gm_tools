#### Fog Cloud

*Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 120 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The Sphere is Heavily Obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by *Gust of Wind*) disperses it.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
