#### Plant Growth

*Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)*

**Casting Time:** Action (Overgrowth) or 8 hours (Enrichment) 

**Range:** 150 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.

**_Overgrowth._** Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.

**_Enrichment._** All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one *Plant Growth* per year.
