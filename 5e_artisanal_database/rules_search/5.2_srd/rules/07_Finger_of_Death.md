#### Finger of Death

*Level 7 Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*

**Casting Time:** Action 

**Range:** 60 feet 

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a **Zombie** (see "Monsters") that follows your verbal orders.
