# Ball Bearings (1 GP)

As a Utilize action, you can spill Ball Bearings from their pouch. They spread to cover a level, 10-footsquare area within 10 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Ball Bearings.
