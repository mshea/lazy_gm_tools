<h4 id="phantomsteed">Phantom Steed</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Illusion (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute or Ritual </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.</p>
<p>For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the <strong>Riding Horse</strong>  stat block (see "Monsters"), except it has a Speed of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.</p>
