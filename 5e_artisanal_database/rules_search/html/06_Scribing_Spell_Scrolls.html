<h2 id="scribingspellscrolls"><strong>Scribing Spell Scrolls</strong></h2>
<p>A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a <em>Spell Scroll</em>, using the rules below.</p>
<h3 id="timeandcost">Time and Cost</h3>
<p>Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisitesforthescribe">Prerequisites for the Scribe</h3>
<p>To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill or with Calligrapher's Supplies and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.</p>
