<h4 id="plantgrowth">Plant Growth</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action (Overgrowth) or 8 hours (Enrichment) </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell channels vitality into plants. The casting time you use determines whether the spell has the Overgrowth or the Enrichment effect below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Overgrowth.</em></strong> Choose a point within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A creature moving through that area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area from being affected.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enrichment.</em></strong> All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for 365 days. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested. They can benefit from only one <em>Plant Growth</em> per year.</p>
