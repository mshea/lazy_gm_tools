<h4 id="expertise">Expertise</h4>
<p>Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a skill proficiency. When you make an ability check with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, your Proficiency Bonus is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature.</p>
<p>If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one skill in which you have proficiency. You can't have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once.</p>
