<h4 id="clairvoyance">Clairvoyance</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Divination (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a focus worth 100+ GP, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create an Invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a Bonus Action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.</p>
<p>A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from <em>See Invisibility</em> or Truesight) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p>
