<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Walk.</em></strong> You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were Difficult Terrain.</p>
