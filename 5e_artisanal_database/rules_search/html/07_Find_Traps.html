<h4 id="findtraps">Find Traps</h4>
<p><em>Level 2 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Ranger)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the <em>Alarm</em> or <em>Glyph of Warding</em> spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.</p>
<p>This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>
