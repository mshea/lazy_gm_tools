<p>If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:</p>
<p><strong>Darkness.</strong> You can see in normal and magical Darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Invisibility.</strong> You see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Illusions.</strong> Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.</p>
<p><strong>Transformations.</strong> You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereal Plane.</strong> You see into the Ethereal Plane.</p>
