<p><em>Level 9 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 1 mile </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 20d6 Fire damage and 20d6 Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.</p>
<p>A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts burning if it's flammable.</p>
