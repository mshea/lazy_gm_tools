<h4 id="guardsandwards">Guards and Wards</h4>
<p><em>Level 6 Abjuration (Bard, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a silver rod worth 10+ GP) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space. The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and you shape it as one 50-foot square, one hundred 5-foot squares that are contiguous, or twenty-five 10-foot squares that are contiguous.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by the spell's effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud within 5 feet of the warded area, makes the speaker immune to its effects.</p>
<p>The spell creates the effects below within the warded area. <em>Dispel Magic</em> has no effect on <em>Guards and Wards</em> itself, but each of the following effects can be dispelled. If all four are dispelled, <em>Guards and Wards</em> ends. If you cast the spell every day for 365 days on the same area, the spell thereafter lasts until all its effects are dispelled.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corridors.</em></strong> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them Heavily Obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you believes it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>
<p><strong><em>Doors.</em></strong> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by the <em>Arcane Lock</em> spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stairs.</em></strong> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as in the <em>Web</em> spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are destroyed while <em>Guards and Wards</em> lasts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other Spell Effect.</em></strong> Place one of the following magical effects within the warded area:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dancing Lights</em> in four corridors, with a simple program that the lights repeat as long as <em>Guards and Wards</em> lasts</li>
<li><em>Magic Mouth</em> in two locations</li>
<li><em>Stinking Cloud</em> in two locations (the vapors return within 10 minutes if dispersed while <em>Guards and Wards</em> lasts)</li>
<li><em>Gust of Wind</em> in one corridor or room (the wind blows continuously while the spell lasts)</li>
<li><em>Suggestion</em> in one 5-foot square; any creature that enters that square receives the suggestion mentally</li>
</ul>
