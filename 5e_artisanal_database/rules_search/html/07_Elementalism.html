<p><em>Transmutation Cantrip (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You exert control over the elements, creating one of the following effects within range.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beckon Air.</em></strong> You create a breeze strong enough to ripple cloth, stir dust, rustle leaves, and close open doors and shutters, all in a 5-foot Cube. Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beckon Earth.</em></strong> You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beckon Fire.</em></strong> You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot Cube. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beckon Water.</em></strong> You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot Cube. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sculpt Element.</em></strong> You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot Cube to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour.</p>
