<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em> </p>
<p>This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 <em>Fireball</em> (save DC 15).</p>
<p>You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the <em>Fireball</em> by 1d6 for each bead after the first (maximum 12d6).</p>
