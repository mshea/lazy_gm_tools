<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.</p>
