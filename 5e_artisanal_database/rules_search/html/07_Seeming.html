<p><em>Level 5 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 8 hours</p>
<p>You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.</p>
<p>You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.</p>
<p>A creature that takes the Study action to examine a target can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.</p>
