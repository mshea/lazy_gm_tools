<h4 id="candleofinvocation">Candle of Invocation</h4>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.</p>
<p>While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast <em>Gate</em> with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the GM or determined by rolling on the following table.</p>
