<h4 id="magiccircle">Magic Circle</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin, Warlock, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 10 feet</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the Cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface.</p>
<p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creature can't willingly enter the Cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li>
<li>The creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the Cylinder.</li>
<li>Targets within the Cylinder can't be possessed by or gain the Charmed or Frightened condition from the creature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the Cylinder and protecting targets outside it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.</p>
