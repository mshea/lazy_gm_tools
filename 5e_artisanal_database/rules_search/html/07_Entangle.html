<p><em>Level 1 Conjuration (Druid, Ranger)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into Difficult Terrain. They disappear when the spell ends.</p>
<p>Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength</p>
<p>saving throw or have the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer Restrained by them.</p>
