<h4 id="instantsummons">Instant Summons</h4>
<p><em>Level 6 Conjuration (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute or Ritual </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000+ GP) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch the sapphire used in the casting and an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an Invisible mark on that object and invisibly inscribes the object's name on the sapphire. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a different sapphire.</p>
<p>Thereafter, you can take a Magic action to speak the object's name and crush the sapphire. The object instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.</p>
<p>If another creature is holding or carrying the object, crushing the sapphire doesn't transport it, but instead you learn who that creature is and where that creature is currently located.</p>
