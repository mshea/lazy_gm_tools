<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p>
<p>These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a Magic action.</p>
<p>While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.</p>
