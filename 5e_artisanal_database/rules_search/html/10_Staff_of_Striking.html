<p><em>Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p>The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 Force damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regaining Charges.</em></strong> The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.</p>
