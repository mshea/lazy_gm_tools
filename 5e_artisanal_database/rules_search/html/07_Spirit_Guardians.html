<h4 id="spiritguardians">Spirit Guardians</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Conjuration (Cleric)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a prayer scroll) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot Emanation for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's Speed is halved in the Emanation, and whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 3.</p>
