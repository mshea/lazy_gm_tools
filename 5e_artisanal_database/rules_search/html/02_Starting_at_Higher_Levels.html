<h2 id="startingathigherlevels">Starting at Higher Levels</h2>
<p>Your GM might start your group's characters at a level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended to start at level 3 if your group is composed of seasoned D&amp;D players.</p>
<h3 id="creatingyourcharacter">Creating Your Character</h3>
<p>Creating a higher-level character uses the same character-creation steps outlined in this chapter and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided in the "Level Advancement" section. You begin with the minimum amount of XP required to reach your starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at level 10, you have 64,000 XP.</p>
<blockquote>
  <h3 id="bonusfeatsatlevel20"><strong>Bonus Feats at Level 20</strong></h3>
  <p>A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after characters reach level 20 to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, each character gains one feat of their choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can choose any feat for which their level 20 character qualifies.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="startingequipment"><strong>Starting Equipment</strong></h3>
<p>The GM decides whether your character starts with more than the standard equipment for a level 1 character, possibly even one or more magic items. The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a guide for the GM.</p>
<p>Also, check with your GM about what equipment is available for you to buy with your starting money. For example, the firearms described in "Equipment" are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they might be available for purchase if your GM allows them.</p>
