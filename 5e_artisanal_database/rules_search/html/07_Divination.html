<p><em>Level 4 Divination (Cleric, Druid, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action or Ritual </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells.</p>
<p>If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.</p>
