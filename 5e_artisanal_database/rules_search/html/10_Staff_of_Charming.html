<h4 id="staffofcharming">Staff of Charming</h4>
<p><em>Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)</em></p>
<p>This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:</p>
<p><strong>Cast Spell.</strong> You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast <em>Charm Person</em>, <em>Command</em>, or <em>Comprehend Languages</em> from it using your spell save DC.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect Enchantment.</strong>* If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.</p>
<p><strong>Resist Enchantment.</strong> If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Regaining Charges.</strong> The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.</p>
