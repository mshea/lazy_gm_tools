<h3 id="abilityscores">Ability Scores</h3>
<p>Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.</p>

<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>This is the lowest a score can normally go. If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect explains what happens.</td>

<td>This represents a weak capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10–11</td>
<td>This represents the human average.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12–19</td>
<td>This represents a strong capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>This is the highest an adventurer’s score can go unless a feature says otherwise.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>21–29</td>
<td>This represents an extraordinary capability.</td>
</tr>

<td>This is the highest a score can go.</td>

<h3 id="abilitymodifiers">Ability Modifiers</h3>
<p>Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in “D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Round Down</strong>
  Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make an exception and tell you to round up.</p>
