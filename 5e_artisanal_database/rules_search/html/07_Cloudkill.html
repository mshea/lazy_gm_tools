<p><em>Level 5 Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by <em>Gust of Wind</em>) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is Heavily Obscured.</p>
<p>Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d8 Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.</p>
<p>The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.</p>
