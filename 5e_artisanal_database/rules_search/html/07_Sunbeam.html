<p><em>Level 6 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a magnifying glass) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long Line. Each creature in the Line makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 Radiant damage and has the Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to create a new Line of radiance.</p>
<p>For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds Bright Light in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.</p>
