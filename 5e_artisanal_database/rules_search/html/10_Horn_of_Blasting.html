<h4 id="hornofblasting">Horn of Blasting</h4>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p>
<p>You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder damage.</p>
<p>Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.</p>
