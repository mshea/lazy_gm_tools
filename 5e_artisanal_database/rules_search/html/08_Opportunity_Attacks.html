<h4 id="opportunityattacks">Opportunity Attacks</h4>
<p>You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its Bonus Action, its Reaction, or one of its speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a Reaction to make one melee attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach. <em>See also</em> "Playing the Game" ("Combat").</p>
