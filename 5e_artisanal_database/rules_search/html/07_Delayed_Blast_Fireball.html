<p><em>Level 7 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 150 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>A beam of yellow light flashes from you, then condenses at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, the bead explodes, and each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes Fire damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>The spell's base damage is 12d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 whenever your turn ends and the spell hasn't ended.</p>
<p>If a creature touches the glowing bead before the spell ends, that creature makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends, causing the bead to explode. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. If the thrown bead enters a creature's space or collides with a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.</p>
<p>When the bead explodes, flammable objects in the explosion that aren't being worn or carried start burning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The base damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 7.</p>
