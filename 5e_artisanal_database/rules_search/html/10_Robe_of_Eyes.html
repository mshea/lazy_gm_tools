<h4 id="robeofeyes">Robe of Eyes</h4>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<p><strong>All-Around Vision.</strong> The robe gives you Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. </p>
<p><strong>Special Senses.</strong> You have Darkvision and Truesight, both with a range of 120 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Drawbacks.</em></strong> A <em>Light</em> spell cast on the robe or a <em>Daylight</em> spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for <em>Light</em> or DC 15 for <em>Daylight</em>), ending the condition on yourself on a success.</p>
