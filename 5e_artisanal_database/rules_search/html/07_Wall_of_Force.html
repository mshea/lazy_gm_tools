<h4 id="wallofforce">Wall of Force</h4>
<p><em>Level 5 Evocation (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a shard of glass) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>An Invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side).</p>
<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <em>Dispel Magic.</em> A <em>Disintegrate</em> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane and blocks ethereal travel through the wall.</p>
