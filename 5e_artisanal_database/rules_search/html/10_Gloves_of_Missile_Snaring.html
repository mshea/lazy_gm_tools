<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.</p>
