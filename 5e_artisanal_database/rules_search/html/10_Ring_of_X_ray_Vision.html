<h4 id="ringofxrayvision">Ring of X-ray Vision</h4>
<p><em>Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.</p>
<p>Whenever you use the ring again before taking a Long Rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level.</p>
