<h2 id="craftingnonmagicalitems">Crafting Nonmagical Items</h2>
<p>To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.</p>
<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>The "Tools" section of "Equipment" lists which tools are required to make certain items. The GM assigns required tools for items not listed there.</p>
<p>You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.</p>
<h3 id="rawmaterials">Raw Materials</h3>
<p>To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.</p>
<p>If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive.</p>
<p>Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.</p>
