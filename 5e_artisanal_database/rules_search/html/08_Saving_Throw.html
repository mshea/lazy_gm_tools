<h4 id="savingthrow">Saving Throw</h4>
<p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally make a saving throw only when a rule requires you to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails. <em>See also</em> "Playing the Game" ("D20 Tests").</p>
