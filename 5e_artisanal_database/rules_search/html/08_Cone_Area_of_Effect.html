<h4 id="coneareaofeffect">Cone [Area of Effect]</h4>
<p>A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator chooses. A Cone's width at any point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point along its length that is 15 feet from the point of origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its maximum length.</p>
<p>A Cone's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.</p>
