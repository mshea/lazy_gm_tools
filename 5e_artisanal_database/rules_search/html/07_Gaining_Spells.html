<h2 id="gainingspells">Gaining Spells</h2>
<p>Before you can cast a spell, you must have the spell prepared in your mind or have access to the spell from a magic item, such as a <em>Spell Scroll</em>. Your features specify which spells you have access to, if any; whether you always have certain spells prepared; and whether you can change the list of spells you have prepared.</p>
<h3 id="preparingspells">Preparing Spells</h3>
<p>If you have a list of level 1+ spells you prepare, your spellcasting feature specifies when you can change the list and the number of spells you can change, as summarized in the Spell Preparation by Class table.</p>
<p>Table: Spell Preparation by Class</p>

<p>Most spellcasting monsters don't change their lists of prepared spells, but the GM is free to alter them.</p>
<h3 id="alwayspreparedspells">Always-Prepared Spells</h3>
<p>Certain features might give you a spell that you always have prepared. If you also have a list of prepared spells that you can change, a spell that you always have prepared doesn't count against the number of spells on that list.</p>
