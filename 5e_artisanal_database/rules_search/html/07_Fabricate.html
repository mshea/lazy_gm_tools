<h4 id="fabricate">Fabricate</h4>
<p><em>Level 4 Transmutation (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.</p>
<p>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot Cube or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot Cube). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials.</p>
<p>Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of skill—such as weapons and armor—unless you have proficiency with the type of Artisan's Tools used to craft such objects.</p>
