<p><em>Level 7 Conjuration (Cleric)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>You conjure a spirit from the Upper Planes, which manifests as a pillar of light in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range. For each creature you can see in the Cylinder, choose which of these lights shines on it:</p>
<p><strong>Healing Light.</strong> The target regains Hit Points equal to 4d12 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Searing Light.</strong> The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d12 Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, Bright Light fills the Cylinder, and when you move on your turn, you can also move the Cylinder up to 30 feet.</p>
<p>Whenever the Cylinder moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the Cylinder or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The healing and damage increase by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 7.</p>
