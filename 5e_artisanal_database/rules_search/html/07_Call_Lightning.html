<h4 id="calllightning">Call Lightning</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Conjuration (Druid)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.</p>
<p>If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 3.</p>
