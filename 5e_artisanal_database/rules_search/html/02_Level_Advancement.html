<h2 id="leveladvancement">Level Advancement</h2>
<p>While going on adventures, your character gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A character who reaches a specified Experience Point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.</p>
<p>The Character Advancement table lists the XP you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience Points column, you reach the corresponding level.</p>

<h3 id="gainingalevel">Gaining a Level</h3>
<p>When you gain a level, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose a Class.</strong> Most characters advance in the same class. However, you might decide to gain a level in another class using the rules in the "Multiclassing" section.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice.</strong> Each time you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die. Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points by Class table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Table: Fixed Hit Points by Class</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Class</th>
<th>Hit Points per Level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Barbarian</td>
<td>7 + Con. modifier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger</td>
<td>6 + Con. modifier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock</td>
<td>5 + Con. modifier</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sorcerer or Wizard</td>
<td>4 + Con. modifier</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Record New Class Features.</strong> Look at your class features table in "Classes," and note the features you gain at your new level in that class. Make any choices offered by a new feature.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Proficiency Bonus.</strong> A character's Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as shown in the Character Advancement table and your class features table in "Classes." When your Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the numbers on your character sheet that include your Proficiency Bonus.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Ability Modifiers.</strong> If you choose a feat that increases one or more of your ability scores, your ability modifier also changes if the new score is an even number. When that happens, adjust all the numbers on your character sheet that use that ability modifier. When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if a character reaches level 8 and increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18, the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The character's Hit Point maximum then increases by 8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reaching level 8.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tiersofplay">Tiers of Play</h3>
<p>With each new level, characters acquire new capabilities that equip them to handle greater challenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of the game also changes, and the stakes of the campaign get higher. It's helpful to think of a character's (and a campaign's) arc in terms of four tiers of play, describing the journey from a level 1 character just beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights of level 20. These tiers don't have any rules associated with them; they point to the fact that the play experience evolves as characters gain levels.</p>
<h4 id="tier1levels14">Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)</h4>
<p>In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers, though they are already set apart from the broader populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities. They learn their starting class features and choose a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a danger to local farmsteads or villages.</p>
<h4 id="tier2levels510">Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)</h4>
<p>In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers. Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as <em>Fireball</em>, <em>Lightning Bolt</em>, and <em>Raise Dead</em>. Most weapon-focused classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in a round. The characters now face dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.</p>
<h4 id="tier3levels1116">Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)</h4>
<p>In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power that makes them special among adventurers. At level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering spells. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or to do more impressive things with those attacks. These adventurers often confront threats to whole regions.</p>
<h4 id="tier4levels1720">Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)</h4>
<p>At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.</p>
