<p><em>Level 4 Illusion (Bard, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a mushroom) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours</p>
<p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot Cube in range look, sound, and smell like another sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed.</p>
<p>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to notice the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature examining the illusion can take the Study action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. If a creature discerns that the terrain is illusory, the creature sees a vague image superimposed on the real terrain.</p>
