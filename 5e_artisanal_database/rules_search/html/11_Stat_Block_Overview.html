<p>A monster has a stat block that contains the rules necessary to use it in the game. Stat blocks are divided into the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name and General Details.</strong> The name of the monster is followed by its size, creature type (along with any descriptive tags), and alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Combat Highlights.</strong> Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, and Initiative are provided here.</li>
<li><strong>Ability Scores.</strong> A monster's ability scores, ability modifiers, and saving throws are listed here.</li>
<li><strong>Other Details.</strong> The monster's Senses, Languages, and CR entries appear here. Additional details appear in some monsters, such as skill proficiencies, Resistances, Immunities, and Gear. If a monster lacks those details, entries for them don't appear.</li>
<li><strong>Traits.</strong> Monster characteristics that are active at all times or during certain situations appear here.</li>
<li><strong>Actions.</strong> The monster can take the actions here in addition to those in "Playing the Game."</li>
