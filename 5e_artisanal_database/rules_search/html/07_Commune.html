<h4 id="commune">Commune</h4>
<p><em>Level 5 Divination (Cleric)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute or Ritual </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
<p>You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.</p>
<p>Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.</p>
<p>If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a Long Rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.</p>
