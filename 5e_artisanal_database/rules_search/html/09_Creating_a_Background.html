<h2 id="creatingabackground">Creating a Background</h2>
<p>A character's background represents what the character did prior to becoming an adventurer. Creating a unique background or customizing an existing one can reflect the particular theme of your campaign or elements of your world. You can also create a background to help a player craft the story they have in mind for their character.</p>
<p>This section describes, step by step, how you can create backgrounds tailored for your world and the heroes in it.</p>
<h3 id="1chooseabilities">1: Choose Abilities</h3>
<p>Choose three abilities that seem appropriate for the background:</p>
<p><strong>Strength or Dexterity.</strong> These abilities are ideal for a background involving physical exertion.</p>
<p><strong>Constitution.</strong> This ability is ideal for a background that involves endurance or long hours of activity.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence or Wisdom.</strong> One or both abilities are ideal for a background that focuses on cerebral or spiritual matters.</p>
<p><strong>Charisma.</strong> This ability is ideal for a background that involves performance or social interaction.</p>
