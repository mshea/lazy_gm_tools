<h4 id="rodofalertness">Rod of Alertness</h4>
<p><em>Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>This rod has the following properties.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alertness.</em></strong> While holding the rod, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on Initiative rolls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Detect Evil and Good</em></li>
<li><em>Detect Magic</em></li>
<li><em>Detect Poison and Disease</em></li>
<li><em>See Invisibility</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Protective Aura.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can sense the location of any Invisible creature that is also in the Bright Light.</p>
<p>The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
