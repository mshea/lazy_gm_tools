<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em></p>
<p>As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle. Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is Heavily Obscured.</p>
<p>Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.</p>
<p>Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the <em>Gust of Wind</em> spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.</p>
