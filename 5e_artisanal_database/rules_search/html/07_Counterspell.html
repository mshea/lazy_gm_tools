<p><em>Level 3 Abjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with Verbal, Somatic, or Material components </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> S</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, Bonus Action, or Reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.</p>
