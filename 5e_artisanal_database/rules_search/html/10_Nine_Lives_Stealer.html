<p><em>Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
<p><strong><em>Life Stealing.</em></strong> The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges. When you attack a creature that has fewer than 100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges remaining, it loses this property.</p>
