<h4 id="slow">Slow</h4>
<p><em>Level 3 Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a drop of molasses) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot Cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>
<p>An affected target's Speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a Bonus Action, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the Attack action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a 25 percent chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.</p>
<p>An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.</p>
