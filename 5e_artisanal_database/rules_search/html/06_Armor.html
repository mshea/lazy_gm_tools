<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>
<p>The Armor table lists the game's main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category.</strong> Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).</li>
<li><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> The table's Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.</li>
<li><strong>Strength.</strong> If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth.</strong> If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="armortraining">Armor Training</h3>
<p>Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.</p>
<h4 id="lightmediumorheavyarmor">Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor</h4>
<p>If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20 Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p>
<h4 id="shield">Shield</h4>
<p>You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.</p>
<h3 id="oneatatime">One at a Time</h3>
<p>A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.</p>
