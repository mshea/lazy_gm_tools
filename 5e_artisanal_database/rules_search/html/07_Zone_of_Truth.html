<h4 id="zoneoftruth">Zone of Truth</h4>
<p><em>Level 2 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes</p>
<p>You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save.</p>
<p>An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful.</p>
