<p><em>Level 3 Necromancy (Bard, Cleric, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose one ability. The target has Disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.</li>
<li>The target has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.</li>
<li>In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the Dodge action on that turn.</li>
<li>If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain Concentration on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require Concentration, and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5–6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7–8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>
