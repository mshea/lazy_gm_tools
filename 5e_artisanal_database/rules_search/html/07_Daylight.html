<p><em>Level 3 Evocation (Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is Bright Light and sheds Dim Light for an additional 60 feet.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.</p>
<p>If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of Darkness created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.</p>
