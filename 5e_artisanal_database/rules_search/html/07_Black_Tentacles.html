<h4 id="blacktentacles">Black Tentacles</h4>
<p><em>Level 4 Conjuration (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 90 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a tentacle) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into Difficult Terrain.</p>
<p>Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 Bludgeoning damage, and it has the Restrained condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.</p>
<p>A Restrained creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.</p>
