<p><em>Potion, Uncommon</em> </p>
<p>When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the <em>Enlarge/Reduce</em> spell for 10 minutes (no Concentration required).</p>
<p>The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.</p>
