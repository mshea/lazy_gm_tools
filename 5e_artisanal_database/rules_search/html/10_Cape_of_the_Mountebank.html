<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em> </p>
<p>This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast <em>Dimension Door</em> as a Magic action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p>When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is Lightly Obscured by that smoke until the end of your next turn.</p>
