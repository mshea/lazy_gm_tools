<h4 id="contingency">Contingency</h4>
<p><em>Level 6 Abjuration (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 days</p>
<p>Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting <em>Contingency</em>, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a <em>Contingency</em> cast with <em>Water Breathing</em> might stipulate that <em>Water Breathing</em> comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.</p>
<p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then <em>Contingency</em> ends.</p>
<p>The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one <em>Contingency</em> spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another <em>Contingency</em> spell on you ends. Also, <em>Contingency</em> ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person.</p>
