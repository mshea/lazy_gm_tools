<h4 id="sequester">Sequester</h4>
<p><em>Level 7 Transmutation (Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (gem dust worth 5,000+ GP, which the spell consumes) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled</p>
<p>With a touch, you magically sequester an object or a willing creature. For the duration, the target has the Invisible condition and can't be targeted by Divination spells, detected by magic, or viewed remotely with magic.</p>
<p>If the target is a creature, it enters a state of suspended animation; it has the Unconscious condition, doesn't age, and doesn't need food, water, or air.</p>
<p>You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.</p>
