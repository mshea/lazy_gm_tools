<h4 id="freedomofmovement">Freedom of Movement</h4>
<p><em>Level 4 Abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a leather strap)</p>
<p>kj<strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by Difficult Terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's Speed nor cause the target to have the Paralyzed or Restrained conditions. The target also has a Swim Speed equal to its Speed.</p>
<p>In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the Grappled condition on it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.</p>
<h3 id="freezingsphere">Freezing Sphere</h3>
<p><em>Level 6 Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a miniature crystal sphere) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous</p>
<p>A frigid globe streaks from you to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius Sphere. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Cold damage on failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p>If the globe strikes a body of water, it freezes the water to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice and have the Restrained condition. A trapped creature can take an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC to break free.</p>
<p>You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell's casting. If you do so, a globe about the size of a sling bullet, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as a normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already shattered, it explodes.</p>
<p><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em> The damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 6.</p>
