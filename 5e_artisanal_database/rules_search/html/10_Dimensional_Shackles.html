<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p>
<p>You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.</p>
<p>You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>
