<h4 id="insectplague">Insect Plague</h4>
<p><em>Level 5 Conjuration (Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 300 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a locust) </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>
<p>Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The Sphere remains for the duration, and its area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain.</p>
<p>When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d10 Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 5.</p>
