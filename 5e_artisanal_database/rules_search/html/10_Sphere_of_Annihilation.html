<h4 id="sphereofannihilation">Sphere of Annihilation</h4>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary</em></p>
<p>This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.</p>
<p>The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a <em>Sphere of Annihilation</em>, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Controlling the Sphere.</em></strong> A <em>Sphere of Annihilation</em> is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line.</p>
<p>While in control of the sphere, you can take a Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sphere Interactions.</em></strong> If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the <em>Gate</em> spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a <em>Portable Hole</em>), the GM determines randomly what happens using the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>1d100</th>
<th>Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>01–50</td>
<td>The sphere is destroyed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>51–85</td>
<td>The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>86–00</td>
<td>A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence.</td>
</tr>
