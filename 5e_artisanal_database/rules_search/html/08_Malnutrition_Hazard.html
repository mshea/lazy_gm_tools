<h4 id="malnutritionhazard">Malnutrition [Hazard]</h4>
<p>A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 Exhaustion level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.</p>
<p>Exhaustion caused by malnutrition can't be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day. <em>See also</em> "Exhaustion."</p>
