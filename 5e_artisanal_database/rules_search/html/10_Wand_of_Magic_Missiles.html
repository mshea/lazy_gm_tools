<p><em>Wand, Uncommon</em></p>
<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast <em>Magic Missile</em> from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.</p>
<p><strong><em>Regaining Charges.</em></strong> The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>
