<h4 id="tremorsense">Tremorsense</h4>
<p>A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.</p>
<p>Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.</p>
