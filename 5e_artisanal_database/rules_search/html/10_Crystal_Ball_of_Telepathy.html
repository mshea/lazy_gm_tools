<p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>While touching this crystal orb, you can cast <em>Scrying</em> (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast <em>Suggestion</em> (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this <em>Suggestion</em> to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if <em>Scrying</em> ends. You can't cast <em>Suggestion</em> in this way again until the next dawn.</p>
