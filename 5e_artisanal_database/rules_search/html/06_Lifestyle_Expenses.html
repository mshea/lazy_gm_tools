<h2 id="lifestyleexpenses">Lifestyle Expenses</h2>
<p>Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.</p>
<p>At the start of each week or month (GM's choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the GM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.</p>
<h3 id="wretchedfree">Wretched (Free)</h3>
<p>You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.</p>
<h3 id="squalid1spperday">Squalid (1 SP per Day)</h3>
<p>You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.</p>
<h3 id="poor2spperday">Poor (2 SP per Day)</h3>
<p>You spend frugally for your necessities.</p>
<h3 id="modest1gpperday">Modest (1 GP per Day)</h3>
<p>You support yourself at an average level.</p>
<h3 id="comfortable2gpperday">Comfortable (2 GP per Day)</h3>
<p>You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.</p>
<h3 id="wealthy4gpperday">Wealthy (4 GP per Day)</h3>
<p>You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.</p>
<h3 id="aristocratic10gpperday">Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)</h3>
<p>You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="fooddrinkandlodging">Food, Drink, and Lodging</h3>
<p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for food and a single night's lodging. Prices for daily lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle's expenses.</p>
