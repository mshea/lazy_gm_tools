<h2 id="magicitemrarity">Magic Item Rarity</h2>
<p>Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table.</p>
<p>Common magic items, such as a <em>Potion of Healing</em>, are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the <em>Dragon Orb</em>, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.</p>
<h3 id="magicitemvaluesbyrarity">Magic Item Values by Rarity</h3>
<p>Common magic items can often be bought in a town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign, rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment.</p>
<p>If a magic item incorporates an item that has a purchase cost in "Equipment" (such as a weapon or a suit of armor), add that item's cost to the magic item's value. For example, <em>+1 Armor</em> (Plate Armor) has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare magic item's value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate Armor (1,500 GP).</p>

<p>*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a <em>Spell Scroll</em>. The value of a <em>Spell Scroll</em> is double what it costs to scribe the scroll (as specified in the "Scribing Spell Scrolls" section of "Equipment").</p>
