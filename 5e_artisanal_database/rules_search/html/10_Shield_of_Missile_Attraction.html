<p><em>Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a <em>Remove Curse</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.</p>
