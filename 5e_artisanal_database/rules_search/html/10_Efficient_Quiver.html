<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em></p>
<p>Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.</p>
<p>You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.</p>
