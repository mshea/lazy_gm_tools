<h4 id="disguiseself">Disguise Self</h4>
<p><em>Level 1 Illusion (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Self </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person look different until the spell ends. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear heavier or lighter. You must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs as you have. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.</p>
<p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature must take the Study action to inspect your appearance and succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>
