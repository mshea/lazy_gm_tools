<p><em>Level 2 Abjuration (Cleric, Paladin)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> Action </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth 50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p>You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has Resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.</p>
<p>The spell ends if you drop to 0 Hit Points or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.</p>
