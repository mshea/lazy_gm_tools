<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em></p>
<p>This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. As a Magic action, you can strike the chime to cast <em>Knock</em>. The spell's customary knocking sound is replaced by the clear, ringing tone of the chime, which is audible out to 300 feet.</p>
<p>The chime can be used 10 times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.</p>
