<h4 id="necklaceofprayerbeads">Necklace of Prayer Beads</h4>
<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)</em></p>
<p>This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.</p>
<p>Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead's spell is cast, that bead can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
