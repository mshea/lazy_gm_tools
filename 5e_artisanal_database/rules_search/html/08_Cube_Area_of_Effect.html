<p>A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side.</p>
<p>A Cube's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.</p>
