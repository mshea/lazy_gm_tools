<p><em>Level 5 Enchantment (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute </p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet </p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V </p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30 days</p>
<p>You give a verbal command to a creature that you can see within range, ordering it to carry out some service or refrain from an action or a course of activity as you decide. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Charmed condition for the duration. The target automatically succeeds if it can't understand your command.</p>
<p>While Charmed, the creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage if it acts in a manner directly counter to your command. It takes this damage no more than once each day.</p>
<p>You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.</p>
<p>A <em>Remove Curse</em>, <em>Greater Restoration</em>, or <em>Wish</em> spell ends this spell.</p>
<p><strong><em>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</em></strong> If you use a level 7 or 8 spell slot, the duration is 365 days. If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.</p>
