<h4 id="improvisedweapons">Improvised Weapons</h4>
<p>An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it's wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Proficiency.</em></strong> Don't add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage.</em></strong> On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the GM thinks is appropriate for the object.</p>
<p><strong><em>Range.</em></strong> If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Weapon Equivalents.</em></strong> If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the GM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules. For example, the GM could treat a table leg as a Club.</p>
