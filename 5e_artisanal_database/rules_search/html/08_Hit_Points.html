<h4 id="hitpoints">Hit Points</h4>
<p>Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can't have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can't have less than 0. <em>See also</em> "Breaking Objects" and "Playing the Game" ("Damage and Healing").</p>
