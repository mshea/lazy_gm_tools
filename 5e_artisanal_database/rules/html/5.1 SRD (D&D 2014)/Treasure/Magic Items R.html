<h1>Magic Items (R)</h1>
<h3>Restorative Ointment</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4+1 doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.</p>

<h3>Ring of Djinni Summoning</h3>

It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.</p>
<p>While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.</p>
<p>After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.</p>

<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>

<h3>Ring of Shooting Stars</h3>
<p><em>Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <em>dancing lights</em> and <em>light</em> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.</p>
<p>The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Faerie Fire</em></strong>. You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <em>faerie fire</em> from the ring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ball Lightning</em></strong>. You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.</p>
<p>Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.</p>

<p><strong><em>Shooting Stars</em></strong>. You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Ring of Spell Storing</h3>
<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
<p>Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
<h3>Ring of Spell Turning</h3>
<p><em>Ring, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.</p>
<h3>Ring of Swimming</h3>
<p><em>Ring, uncommon</em></p>
<p>You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.</p>
<h3>Ring of Telekinesis</h3>
<p><em>Ring, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can cast the <em>telekinesis</em> spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.</p>
<h3>Ring of the Ram</h3>
<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.</p>
<h3>Ring of Three Wishes</h3>
<p><em>Ring, legendary</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the <em>wish</em> spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.</p>
<h3>Ring of Warmth</h3>
<p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h3>Ring of Water Walking</h3>
<p><em>Ring, uncommon</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.</p>
<h3>Ring of X-ray Vision</h3>
<p><em>Ring, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.</p>
<p>Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.</p>
<h3>Robe of Eyes</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</li>
<li>You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.</li>
<li>You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.</p>
<p>A <em>light</em> spell cast on the robe or a <em>daylight</em> spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for <em>light</em> or DC 15 for <em>daylight</em>), ending the blindness on a success.</p>
<h3>Robe of Scintillating Colors</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.</p>
<h3>Robe of Stars</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.</p>
<p>Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of the stars and use it to cast <em>magic missile</em> as a 5th-level spell. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.</p>
<p>While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
<h3>Robe of the Archmagi</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em></p>
<p>This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe's color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can't attune to a <em>robe of the archmagi</em> that doesn't correspond to your alignment.</p>
<p>You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15+your Dexterity modifier.</li>
<li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</li>
<li>Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Robe of Useful Items</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.</p>
<p>The robe has two of each of the following patches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dagger</li>
<li>Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)</li>
<li>Steel mirror</li>
<li>10-foot pole</li>

<li>Sack</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches or determines them randomly.</p>

<h3>Rod of Absorption</h3>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy-not the spell itself-is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>
<p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>
<p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>
<p>A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p>
<h3>Rod of Alertness</h3>
<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alertness</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spells</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>detect poison and disease</em>, or <em>see invisibility.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Protective Aura</em></strong>. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.</p>
<p>The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<h3>Rod of Lordly Might</h3>
<p><em>Rod, legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Six Buttons</em></strong>. You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a <em>flame tongue</em>, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>
<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Drain Life</em></strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Paralyze</em></strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Terrify</em></strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<h3>Rod of Rulership</h3>
<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
<h3>Rod of Security</h3>
<p><em>Rod, very rare</em></p>
<p>While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.</p>
<p>For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).</p>
<p>When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed.</p>
<h3>Rope of Climbing</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>This 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.</p>
<p>If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.</p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>
<h3>Rope of Entanglement</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em></p>
<p>This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.</p>
<p>You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.</p>
<p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>
