<h3>Weapon, +1, +2, or +3</h3>
<p><em>Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)</em></p>
<p>You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the weapon's rarity.</p>
<h3>Well of Many Worlds</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em></p>
<p>This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>You can use an action to unfold and place the <em>well of many worlds</em> on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once <em>well of many worlds</em> has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.</p>
<h3>Wind Fan</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em></p>
<p>While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the <em>gust of wind</em> spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p>
<h3>Winged Boots</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.</p>
<p>The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.</p>
<h3>Wings of Flying</h3>
<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
<p>While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can't use them again for 1d12 hours.</p>
