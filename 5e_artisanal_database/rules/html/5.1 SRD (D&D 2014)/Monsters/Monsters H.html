<p><strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3</p>
<p><strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14</p>
<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic, Sylvan</p>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 3 (700 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Amphibious</em></strong>. The hag can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting</em></strong>. The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material Components</p>
<p>At will: <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>minor illusion</em>, <em>vicious mockery</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mimicry</em></strong>. The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Illusory Appearance</em></strong>. The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.</p>
<p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p>
<p><strong><em>Invisible Passage</em></strong>. The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>

<p><strong>Languages</strong> Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Primordial</p>
<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting</em></strong>. The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material Components</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect magic</em>, <em>magic missile</em></p>
<p>2/day each: <em>plane shift</em> (self only), <em>ray of enfeeblement</em>, <em>sleep</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance</em></strong>. The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Claws (Hag Form Only)</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8+4) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape</em></strong>. The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Etherealness</em></strong>. The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a <em>heartstone</em> in her possession.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)</em></strong>. While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A <em>protection from evil and good</em> spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a <em>magic circle</em>. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's <em>soul bag</em>. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or similar magic.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Amphibious</em></strong>. The hag can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrific Appearance</em></strong>. Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>

<p>The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p>

<p><strong><em>Luring Song</em></strong>. The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.</p>
<p>While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p>
<p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.</p>
