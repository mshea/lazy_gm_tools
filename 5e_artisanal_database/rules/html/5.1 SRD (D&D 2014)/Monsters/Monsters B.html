<p><strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong>. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p>A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
<p>If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 11 (7,200 XP)</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack</em></strong>. The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (3d10+6) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Constrict</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d10+6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10+6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)</em></strong>. The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Swallow</em></strong>. The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p>
<p>If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<h2>Bugbear</h2>

<p><strong>Armor Class</strong> 16 (hide armor, shield)</p>

<p><strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP)</p>
<p><strong><em>Standing Leap</em></strong>. The bulette's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.</p>
<h6>Actions</h6>
<p><strong><em>Bite</em></strong>. <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 30 (4d12+4) piercing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deadly Leap</em></strong>. If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6+4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6+4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space.</p>
