# Concentration

Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. If the effect's creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.

**_Another Concentration Effect._** You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.

**_Damage._** If you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30.

**_Incapacitated or Dead._** Your Concentration ends if you have the Incapacitated condition or you die.
