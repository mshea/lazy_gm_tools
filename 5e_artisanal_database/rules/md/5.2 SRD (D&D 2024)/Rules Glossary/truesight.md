# Truesight

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

**Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical Darkness.

**Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the Invisible condition.

**Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on saving throws against them.

**Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.

**Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.
