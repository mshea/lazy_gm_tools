When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet o f that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side o f the wall deals no damage. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** When you cast this spell using a level spell slot 5 or more, the damage of the spell increases by 1d8 for each level of higher spell slot to 4.
