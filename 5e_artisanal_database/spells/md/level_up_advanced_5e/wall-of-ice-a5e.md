- **Level**: 6 Evocation

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere, either with a radius of up to 10 feet. You may also choose to create a flat surface made up of a contiguous group of ten 10-foot square sections. The wall is 1 foot thick.

If the wall enters a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of it (your choice).

In addition, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

The wall is an object with vulnerability to fire damage, with AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the section occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by 2d6 and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
