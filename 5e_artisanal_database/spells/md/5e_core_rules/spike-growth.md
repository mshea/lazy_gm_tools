The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. The development of land is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that does not see the area when the spell is spell casts must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
